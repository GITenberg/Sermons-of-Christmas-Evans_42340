<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sermons of Christmas Evans
contained in this volume, and the extracts from his journal and
other writings given in the following Memoir and Portraiture, are
translated by two different hands, and in very different
styles.&nbsp; The former are clothed in very good English, but
the diction of the latter requires an apology.&nbsp; Unable to
procure a better version, we have furnished such as we found; and
it is hoped that even this, with all its imperfections, will not
be wholly unprofitable to the reader.</p>
<p>The writer does not wish to be held responsible for the
Theological Views put forth, either in the extracts alluded to,
or in the sermons.&nbsp; Christmas Evans was a Calvinistic
Baptist, and several of his sermons inculcate, to some extent,
the peculiar doctrines of that denomination; though they are
generally free from sectarian bias, and may be read with
advantage by spiritual Christians of all evangelical creeds.</p>

9</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> introduction of Christianity
into Britain is said to have taken place about sixty-three years
after the crucifixion.&nbsp; By whose agency it was effected,
cannot now be satisfactorily determined.&nbsp; Tradition has
ascribed it to Joseph of Arimathea.&nbsp; This, however, is
exceedingly doubtful.&nbsp; It has also been attributed to the
apostle Paul.&nbsp; That the apostle Paul visited Britain, is
quite probable, from the testimony of Theodoret and Jerome.&nbsp;
That he was the first preacher of the gospel in Britain, is
certainty a mistake.&nbsp; The weight of evidence seems to be in
favour of Claudia, a Welsh lady, belonging to C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
household.&nbsp; The circumstances were these:&mdash;</p>
<p>The Romans invaded Britain about fifty years before the
incarnation.&nbsp; Failing to conquer the Welsh, they made peace
with them, and dwelt among them in amity.&nbsp; Many Welsh
soldiers joined the Roman army, and several Welsh families went
and resided at Rome.&nbsp; Among the latter were Claudia and her
husband.&nbsp; Saint Paul was then a prisoner under Nero;
dwelling, however, &ldquo;in his own hired house,&rdquo; and
receiving all who came to hear the word of God.&nbsp; Under his
ministry, Claudia was converted to Christianity.&nbsp; She soon
returned to her native country, and scattered &ldquo;the Seed of
the Kingdom&rdquo; among her own people.&nbsp; This was in the
year of our Lord sixty-three.</p>
<p>About a century after this, Faganus and Daminicanus went to
Rome, were converted there, and became &ldquo;able ministers of
the New Testament.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the year of our Lord 180, they
were sent back to Wales, to preach to their own countrymen.&nbsp;
They were zealous and successful laborers.&nbsp; They opposed the
pagan superstitions of the Welsh with wonderful energy.&nbsp;
They pursued Druidism to its dark retirements, and poured upon it
the withering blaze of the gospel.&nbsp; Through their preaching,
Lucius, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>king of Wales, was brought to embrace
Christianity.&nbsp; He was the first king that ever bowed to the
Prince of Peace.&nbsp; The royal convert was exceedingly zealous
in the propagation of the truth.&nbsp; The Macedonian cry issued
from the throne of Wales, an earnest appeal to Eleutherius for
help.&nbsp; Then &ldquo;the word of the Lord had free course, and
was glorified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the reign of Dioclesian, about the year 300, the Welsh
Christians suffered a dreadful persecution.&nbsp; Their books
were burned, their houses of worship were destroyed, and
multitudes obtained the crown of martyrdom.&nbsp; The first three
were Alban, Aaron, and Julius.&nbsp; They were all excellent men,
and greatly beloved by their brethren.&nbsp; They died in
triumph, and their blood became the seed of the church.&nbsp;
Many others soon followed them in the same path.&nbsp; Dioclesian
gave strict orders for their destruction.&nbsp; Not a Christian
was to be spared, not a Christian church, not a book or a scrap
of writing that could transmit their faith and history to future
generations.&nbsp; This was the tenth persecution.&nbsp; The
great dragon had sent forth his flood to destroy the
church.&nbsp; But &ldquo;mightily grew the word of God and
prevailed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bush still lived,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And flourished unconsumed in
fire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first Christian king, we have said, was a Welshman.&nbsp;
So, in part, was the first Christian emperor.&nbsp; Constantine
the Great was born in Britain.&nbsp; His father was Roman; his
mother Welsh.&nbsp; Having resided some time in Britain, they
removed to Rome.&nbsp; Constantine ascended the Imperial
throne.&nbsp; Converted, he made Christianity the religion of the
empire.&nbsp; The intolerant edicts of his predecessors were
abolished; and the absurd rites of paganism, as far as possible,
suppressed.&nbsp; The emperor employed all his energies and
resources in spreading the gospel.&nbsp; But his course, if
honest, was injudicious.&nbsp; In the end, he dishonoured
Christianity more by his imprudence, than he glorified her at
first by his zeal.&nbsp; He opened the door of the church so wide
as to admit Antichrist himself.&nbsp; The &ldquo;man of
sin&rdquo; came and seated himself in the temple of God.</p>
<p>Intoxicated with her prosperity, the church throughout the
empire gradually embraced the grossest superstitions.&nbsp; But
the Welsh Christians strenuously resisted all innovations.&nbsp;
They adhered firmly to the primitive simplicity of Christian
faith and worship.&nbsp; Yet they lost a portion of their
spirituality.&nbsp; The storms <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of tribulation are often more
favourable to the growth of vital religion, than the sunshine of
prosperity.&nbsp; The church becomes dizzy when placed upon the
pinnacle of worldly praise.&nbsp; The boatmen wax careless when
their craft glides gently along on a smooth sea, before a
pleasant gale.&nbsp; This is the natural tendency of the human
mind, in circumstances of prosperity.&nbsp; It was thus with the
Christians of Wales.</p>
<p>Other things operated unfavourably.&nbsp; The Pelagian
controversy divided and distracted the churches, and destroyed
the spirit of Christian meekness and love.&nbsp; The Welsh were
soon involved in a civil war with the Picts and Scots.&nbsp; In
their distress, they solicited the aid of the Saxons.&nbsp; The
Saxons promptly responded to the call.&nbsp; But the ally soon
became an enemy.&nbsp; They fell upon the Welsh, drove them to
the mountains of Cumry, and took possession of their land. <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; These disasters threatened the
extermination of Christianity in Wales.&nbsp; But there were a
few faithful ones, whose ark outrode the deluge.&nbsp; Gildas,
Dyfrig, Dynawt, Teil, Padarn, Pawlin, Daniel, Codag, Dewi, and
several others, stood firmly against the degeneracy of the times,
and were &ldquo;valiant for the truth upon the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through their labors, the religion of Jesus
survived among the hills of Cumry.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the seventh century, Austin came to
Britain, under a commission from Gregory the Great, to make
proselytes to popery.&nbsp; He succeeded well with the Saxons,
but not at all with the Welsh.&nbsp; This is not strange.&nbsp;
The Saxons were ignorant idolaters, and the transition was easy
from Paganism to popery.&nbsp; The Welsh were enlightened
Christians, and it was difficult to seduce them from their
allegiance to Christ.&nbsp; They consented, however, to hold a
large meeting on the borders of Herefordshire, and hear what
Austin had to offer.&nbsp; His doctrine did not suit them.&nbsp;
They rejected alike the proposals of the monk and the commands of
his master.&nbsp; This awoke the fiend within him.&nbsp; He
instigated the Saxons to murder them.&nbsp; Twelve hundred
ministers and delegates were slaughtered, and afterward many of
their brethren.&nbsp; Their leaders being slain, the majority of
the survivors reluctantly purchased peace at the sacrifice of
conscience, submitting to the creed <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and the usages of Rome.&nbsp; Yet
there were some who repudiated the doctrine of the pope&rsquo;s
supremacy, and maintained for a season the simplicity of the
gospel.&nbsp; But they lived among the mountains, in seclusion
from the world, like the inhabitants of the vale of
Piedmont.&nbsp; We hear little or nothing of them again till the
time of the Reformation.</p>
<p>While the Lord, through the labors of his servant Wickliffe,
was preparing his way in England, Wales also was remembered in
mercy, and visited with &ldquo;the day-spring from on
high.&rdquo;&nbsp; Walter Brute was a native of the
principality.&nbsp; He had been at Oxford, where he had formed an
intimate acquaintance with Wickliffe.&nbsp; He entered fully into
Wickliffe&rsquo;s views concerning the reformation of the
church.&nbsp; His heart was moved with compassion for his
countrymen.&nbsp; Inspired with apostolic faith and zeal, he left
the university, and returned to his native land.&nbsp; He
determined to resist, even &ldquo;unto blood,&rdquo; the
delusions and abominations of the papacy.&nbsp; He soon
distinguished himself as a courageous reformer.&nbsp; He preached
in the streets, in the markets, and from house to house.&nbsp; He
blew the trump of God throughout the principality.&nbsp; The
temple of Antichrist began to tremble, and its gilded and
pampered occupants manifested considerable uneasiness and
alarm.</p>
<p>Everybody saw that Brute was generous and disinterested.&nbsp;
Friends flocked around him, for the people had long since become
disgusted with the corruptions of the church, and heartily sick
of ecclesiastical despotism.&nbsp; Men of all classes gathered to
his standard.&nbsp; His labors of love soon elicited, of course,
the hostility of the clergy.&nbsp; But so numerous and
respectable were his friends, that all the attempts of
ecclesiastical judicatures, and officers of the civil law, were
ineffectual.&nbsp; A petition was at length sent to Richard II.,
King of England, entreating his interference.&nbsp; The king
issued an order to the nobility of Wales, requiring them to
assist the Bishop of Hereford in apprehending and punishing the
heretic and his adherents.&nbsp; This was in the year 1391.&nbsp;
Still Walter Brute went on, preaching the gospel, denouncing the
papacy, and exposing the corruptions of the church, without
material molestation, till 1393.&nbsp; He was then cited to
appear before the Bishop of Hereford, to answer to a charge of
heresy.&nbsp; He appeared, defended himself against the
allegation, and contended boldly that the pope was Antichrist,
and the papal church Babylon.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>In this
argument, Brute triumphed over his accusers, and made many
converts to his cause.&nbsp; Several of the clergy now embraced
his views, and became zealous defenders of the faith.&nbsp; One
of these, Davydd Ddu of Hiraddug, on the border of Cardiganshire,
undertook a translation of the Scriptures into Welsh.&nbsp;
Portions of this translation were extensively circulated.&nbsp;
Another, John Kent, D.D., of Grismond, in Monmouthshire, was a
learned man and a fine poet.&nbsp; He labored incessantly with
his pen, to expose the vices of the clergy, and promote a more
spiritual religion.&nbsp; These divines were variously opposed
and persecuted by ecclesiastical power.&nbsp; They were
stigmatized as magicians, and accused of intercourse with evil
spirits.&nbsp; But all was unavailing.&nbsp; The zeal of Ddu and
Kent was unabated, and the progress of truth was
unretarded.&nbsp; The hand of God was with them wherever they
went.&nbsp; Revivals occurred in the cloisters, and monks came
forth from their seclusion to reinforce the reformers.&nbsp; In
the monastery of Margam, Glamorganshire, a large number of the
monks were converted.&nbsp; One of them, Thomas Evan ab Rhys,
travelled the mountains of the principality, at the constant
peril of his life, to remonstrate against popery, and recommend a
purer form of Christianity.</p>
<p>In 1580, John Penry, an Episcopal minister, dissented from the
established church, and became a Baptist.&nbsp; He was a man of
liberal education and fine pulpit talents.&nbsp; After having
prosecuted his ministry more than seven years, with remarkable
zeal and success, he died a martyr.&nbsp; Penry was the first
Baptist preacher in Wales after the Reformation.</p>
<p>In 1620, Erbury and Wroth followed his example.&nbsp; The
conversion of the latter was very singular.&nbsp; A nobleman
belonging to his parish went to London to attend a
law-suit.&nbsp; Hearing that he was successful, Mr. Wroth bought
a new violin, and prepared to welcome his return with music and
dancing.&nbsp; While these preparations were going on, news came
that the nobleman was dead.&nbsp; The joy of the party was
suddenly turned into mourning.&nbsp; The vicar fell upon his
knees, and poured out his heart in fervent prayer to God.&nbsp;
This event occasioned his conversion.&nbsp; Erbury, his friend,
was converted about the same time.&nbsp; Both began to preach
with wonderful unction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesus Christ and him
crucified&rdquo; was their constant theme.&nbsp; Their zeal drew
down upon them a violent storm of persecution.&nbsp; But they
were not discouraged.&nbsp; God owned their <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>labors, and
many were the seals of their ministry.&nbsp; In 1635 they were
ejected from their parishes.&nbsp; But they &ldquo;cared for none
of these things.&rdquo;&nbsp; They went from valley to valley,
from mountain to mountain, preaching the word.&nbsp; The recent
Welsh translation of the Scriptures proved a powerful auxiliary
to their work.&nbsp; People read and investigated for themselves,
and found that these were men of God, speaking &ldquo;the words
of truth and soberness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Erbury and Wroth both organized Baptist churches; the former,
on the plan of &ldquo;strict communion;&rdquo; the latter, on
more liberal principles.&nbsp; These were the first Baptist
churches instituted in Wales, after the Reformation from
popery.&nbsp; It is said, however, that there existed, even
centuries before, many Baptists in the valley of Carleon, the
Piedmont of Wales, and among the neighboring mountains.&nbsp;
Their origin is, very unfortunately, involved in obscurity.&nbsp;
Some pretend to trace them back to the year 63, the time of the
introduction of Christianity into Britain.&nbsp; This is a very
convenient theory for those who wish to show that the first
Christians were exclusive immersionists; and who deem it of
primary importance to establish a regular succession of such
Christians, from the apostles of our Lord, down to the present
day.&nbsp; But it is unsustained by a single shadow of evidence,
beyond the bare assertion of interested witnesses.</p>
<p>During the ministry of Erbury and Wroth, arose that
morning-star of the Baptist church in Wales, Vavasor
Powell.&nbsp; He was born in Radnorshire, South Wales.&nbsp; He
was educated for the ministry of the established church.&nbsp;
For some time he officiated at Clun, on the borders of
Shropshire.&nbsp; While there, his conscience was awakened by a
reproof from a Puritan for violating the Sabbath.&nbsp; He was
soon afterwards converted, under the preaching of Walter
Caradock, a noted preacher among the Independents.&nbsp; In 1636,
he joined the Baptists, and shortly became a very popular
preacher among them.&nbsp; He was a man of great eloquence and
power.&nbsp; Many were converted under his ministry.&nbsp; But
the red dragon was roused to pursue him.&nbsp; In 1642, he fled
his native land for the safety of his life.&nbsp; In four years,
however, he returned, and preached boldly throughout the
country.&nbsp; The people flocked to hear him, by thousands, to
the market-houses, to the fields, the woods, and the tops of the
mountains.&nbsp; His ministry was wonderfully blessed to the
salvation of souls.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>After
the death of Cromwell, in 1658, Charles II. returned to
England.&nbsp; Now commenced a dreadful persecution of the
Baptists in Wales.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hundreds of them were taken from
their beds at night, without any regard to age, sex, or the
inclemency of the weather; and were driven to prison, on foot,
fifteen or twenty miles; and if they did not keep up with their
drivers on horseback, they were most cruelly and unmercifully
whipped; and while their drivers stopped to drink at the taverns,
they were beaten like cattle, during the pleasure of the
king&rsquo;s friends; and all their property was forfeited to the
king, except what was deemed necessary to defray the expenses of
their drivers.&nbsp; But all this was only the beginning of
sorrows, and nothing to what they suffered for the space of
six-and-twenty years afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these persecutions, Vavasor Powell bore his part.&nbsp; He
was immured, at different times, in thirteen prisons.&nbsp;
Indeed, he was a prisoner most of the time till his death, which
happened in 1670.&nbsp; On his tomb is this
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;He was, to the last generation, a
successful preacher; to the present generation, a faithful
witness; to the next generation, an excellent example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contemporary with Vavasor Powell, and immediately succeeding
him, were many faithful laborers in the cause of Christ in
Wales.&nbsp; One of them was the noted Roger Williams, who
subsequently removed to New England, and founded the Baptist sect
in America.&nbsp; But after the death of Powell and his
coadjutors, the revival in Wales declined, and the churches
gradually settled into a spiritual sleep, in which they remained
a century, when they were roused by the trumpet-tongued eloquence
of Harris and Rowlands.</p>
<p>Harris and Rowlands were Methodists.&nbsp; While Whitefield
and Wesley were rekindling the fires of the Reformation on the
altars of England, these men of God were scattering some sparks
of it among the mountains of Wales.&nbsp; Under their labors
commenced such a revival as was never known in that country
before.&nbsp; They adhered to the established church; and, on
that account, were, for a season, but little opposed.&nbsp; But
when the blessed fruits of their ministry began to be developed
in the conversion of thousands of souls, the wrath of Satan and
his emissaries arose against them.&nbsp; But, as Christmas Evans
remarks, it was now too late.&nbsp; The sword of the Spirit was
drawn; the gates of the city were opened; the fire was kindled in
the stubble, and not all the floods of persecution <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>could stay
the progress of the flame.&nbsp; Harris and Rowlands went forward
in their work of love, clothed with power from on high.&nbsp; A
great and effectual door was opened to their ministry, and the
leaven spread rapidly through the lump.</p>
<p>The Baptists shared largely in this work of grace.&nbsp; It
was the rising of a new sun upon them, which had been heralded a
hundred years before in the powerful ministry of Vavasor
Powell.&nbsp; The revival developed whatever of talent and energy
lay dormant in the denomination.&nbsp; Many a David went forth to
meet the Philistine, and returned in triumph.&nbsp; One of these,
and the most successful of them all, was <span
class="smcap">Christmas Evans</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a man
of God,&rdquo; says Dr. Cone, &ldquo;and eminently useful in his
generation.&rdquo;&nbsp; His natural talents were of the highest
order, and his Christian graces have not been surpassed in a
century.&nbsp; The celebrated Robert Hall regarded him as the
first pulpit genius of the age.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had he enjoyed the
advantages of education,&rdquo; writes one who knew him well, and
often sat under his ministry, &ldquo;he might have blended the
impassioned declamation of Whitefield with something of the
imperial opulence and pomp of fancy that distinguished Jeremy
Taylor.&rdquo;&nbsp; His two celebrated &ldquo;Specimens of Welsh
Preaching&rdquo; have been read throughout Protestant
Christendom; and ranked, by universal suffrage, among the most
splendid productions of sanctified genius.&nbsp; Who that has
seen them does not wish to know more of so remarkable a
man?&nbsp; To gratify this desire is a secondary object of the
present publication; the primary, is the religious benefit of
mankind.&nbsp; The matter of the following memoir and portraiture
is compiled from several authentic sources of information.&nbsp;
May their perusal afford the reader as rich a harvest of profit
and delight as their preparation has afforded the writer!</p>
<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>MEMOIR.</h2>
<h3>EARLY YEARS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Christmas Evans</span>, second son of
Samuel and Joanna Evans, was born at Ysgarwen, Cardiganshire,
South Wales, on the 25th of December, 1776.&nbsp; His birth
happening on Christmas day suggested his Christian name.</p>
<p>Samuel and Joanna Evans were poor, and unable to educate their
children; and at the age of seventeen, Christmas could not read a
word.&nbsp; When he was only nine years old, he lost his father
and went to live with his uncle, who was a farmer, and a very
wicked man.&nbsp; Here he spent several years of his youthful
life, daily witnessing the worst of examples, and experiencing
the unkindest of treatment.&nbsp; He subsequently engaged as a
servant to several farmers successively in his native parish.</p>
<p>During these years he met with a number of serious accidents,
in some of which he narrowly escaped with his life.&nbsp; Once he
was stabbed in a quarrel.&nbsp; Once he was so nearly drowned as
to be with difficulty resuscitated.&nbsp; Once he fell from a
very high tree, with an open knife in his hand.&nbsp; Once a
horse ran away with him, passing at full speed through a low and
narrow passage.</p>
<h3>PROFESSION OF RELIGION.</h3>
<p>His first religious impressions he dates from his
father&rsquo;s funeral.&nbsp; But they were fitful and
evanescent.&nbsp; To use his own language, &ldquo;They vanished
and recurred once and again.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he was eighteen
years of age, an awakening occurred among the young people of his
neighborhood.&nbsp; Christmas himself was &ldquo;much terrified
with the fear of death and judgment,&rdquo; became very serious
in his deportment, and joined the Arminian Presbyterians at
Llwynrhydowen.</p>
<p>His Christian experience was evidently very imperfect.&nbsp;
He had a conviction of the evil of sin, and a desire to flee from
the wrath <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>to come; but no evidence of acceptance with God, and a
very limited knowledge of the plan of salvation.&nbsp; Yet his
religious impressions were not entirely fruitless.&nbsp; They
produced, at least, a partial reformation of life, and led to
many penitential resolutions.&nbsp; He thought much of eternity,
and was frequent in secret prayer.&nbsp; He soon felt a strong
desire to understand the Scriptures, and with this view began to
learn to read.&nbsp; According to his own account, &ldquo;There
was not one in seven in those parts at that time that knew a
letter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Almost entirely unaided, he prosecuted his
purpose; and in an incredibly short time was able to read his
Bible.</p>
<h3>COMMENCEMENT OF PREACHING.</h3>
<p>He was now called upon to exercise his gifts in public prayer
and exhortation.&nbsp; &ldquo;To this,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I
felt a strong inclination, though I knew myself a mass of
spiritual ignorance.&rdquo;&nbsp; His first performance was so
generally approved, that he felt greatly encouraged to
proceed.&nbsp; Shortly afterward, he preached a sermon at a
prayer-meeting, in the parish of Llangeler, county of
Caermarthen.&nbsp; The discourse, however, was not original, but
a translation from Bishop Beveridge.&nbsp; He also committed one
of the Rev. Mr. Rowlands&rsquo; sermons, and preached it in the
neighborhood of the church to which he belonged.&nbsp; A
gentleman who heard him expressed great astonishment at such a
sermon from an unlettered boy.&nbsp; The mystery was solved the
next day; he found the sermon in a book.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I have
not done thinking,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that there is something
great in the son of Samuel the shoemaker, for his prayer was as
good as the sermon.&rdquo;&nbsp; His opinion of the young
preacher would probably have suffered some farther abatement, if
he had known, what was the fact, that the prayer itself was
memorized!</p>
<p>Young Evans now received frequent invitations to preach, in
sundry places, for different denominations; especially in the
Baptist church, at Penybont, Llandysil.&nbsp; He spoke
occasionally in the pulpits of several eminent ministers.&nbsp;
All who heard him were delighted with his discourses, and gave
him much encouragement.&nbsp; These labors drew him into the
society of many excellent Christians.&nbsp; He seems to have
profited by their godly conversation, and soon acquired an
experimental knowledge of justification by faith, though the
witness of the Spirit was not so clear as in many <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>cases, and he
could never fix upon any particular time when he obtained the
blessing.</p>
<h3>BACKSLIDING AND RECOVERY.</h3>
<p>The young preacher shortly felt the need of a little more
learning, to qualify him for his calling.&nbsp; He commenced
going to school to the Rev. Mr. Davis, his pastor, and devoted
himself for about six months to the study of Latin.&nbsp; This
involved him in pecuniary distress.&nbsp; He took a journey into
England, to labour during the harvest season, for the purpose of
replenishing his purse, and enabling him to continue his
studies.&nbsp; While thus engaged, he fell into temptation, and
his religious feelings suffered a sad declension.&nbsp; He
thought of relinquishing the school and the ministry, and
devoting his life to secular pursuits.&nbsp; While revolving this
matter in his mind, the children of the wicked one came upon him,
and buffeted him back to his duty.&nbsp; He was waylaid by a mob,
who had determined to kill him.&nbsp; They beat him so severely,
that he lay for a long time insensible; and one of them gave him
a blow upon his left eye, which occasioned its total blindness
through the rest of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I dreamed that the
day of judgment was come.&nbsp; I saw Jesus on the clouds, and
all the world on fire.&nbsp; I was in great fear, yet crying
earnestly, and with some confidence, for his peace.&nbsp; He
answered and said: &lsquo;Thou thoughtest to be a preacher; but
what wilt thou do now?&nbsp; The world is on fire, and it is too
late!&rsquo;&nbsp; On this I awoke, and felt heartily thankful
that I was in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This dream produced a deep impression upon his mind, and
recovered him from his spiritual declension.&nbsp; He began to
preach with renewed energy and success, and all his friends
predicted that he would &ldquo;yet become a great man, and a
celebrated preacher.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHANGE OF VIEWS.</h3>
<p>There was living, about this time, at Aberduar, a Mr. Amos,
who had left the Arminian Presbyterians, and joined the
Calvinistic Baptists.&nbsp; He came to visit young Evans, and
converse with him on the subject of baptism.&nbsp; The latter was
unpractised in argument, and little acquainted with the
Scriptures.&nbsp; He strove strenuously <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>for a while,
but was at length silenced by the superior skill of his
antagonist.&nbsp; Encouraged by his success, Mr. Amos made him
another visit, during which he shook his faith in the validity of
infant baptism.&nbsp; After this he came again and again.&nbsp;
Mr. Evans was at length brought to believe there was no true
baptism but immersion by a Baptist minister.&nbsp; Now it was
suggested that he ought to be immersed.&nbsp; Other Baptist
friends interested themselves in his case, and put into his hands
such books as were best adapted to their purpose.&nbsp; He was
shortly satisfied what was his duty.&nbsp; &ldquo;After much
struggling,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;between the flesh and the
spirit, between obedience and disobedience, I went to the Baptist
church at Aberduar, in the parish of Llanybyther, in the county
of Caermarthen.&nbsp; I was cordially received there, but not
without a degree of dread, on the part of some, that I was still
a stout-hearted Arminian.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was baptized with
several others, by the pastor, Rev. Timothy Thomas, in the river
Duar, and admitted to the communion of the church.&nbsp; This was
in 1788, when Mr. Evans was about the age of 22.</p>
<p>It is not strange, that, after such a change, he should
gradually imbibe the doctrine of election, and its concomitants,
as held by the Calvinistic Baptists; but it is quite evident, not
only by inference from his own account, but by information from
other sources, that he had not yet relinquished his Arminian
theology.&nbsp; Whether he would have been more pious and useful,
by adhering to his Arminian views, and remaining among his
Arminian friends, is a question not for us to answer, and perhaps
of little practical importance.&nbsp; It is certain that he
became a Calvinist of the highest school, and &ldquo;a burning
and shining light&rdquo; among his Baptist brethren.&nbsp; That
the Calvinistic faith is not incompatible with eminent holiness
of life, we have other evidence than that afforded by the history
of Christmas Evans.&nbsp; The seraphic piety of a Bunyan, a
Baxter, a Whitefield, and a Payson, should silence for ever the
clamors of Arminian bigotry!</p>
<h3>DEPRESSING VIEWS OF HIMSELF.</h3>
<p>For several years after this, Mr. Evans entertained painfully
depressing views of his Christian character and ministerial
talents.&nbsp; He thought every other believer had more light
than himself, and <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>every other preacher greater gifts.&nbsp; He called
himself &ldquo;a mass of ignorance and sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
imagined his discourses entirely useless to his hearers.&nbsp;
This he attributed partly to his habit of repeating them
<i>memoriter</i>.&nbsp; Others appeared to him to speak
extemporaneously, and he &ldquo;thought they received their
sermons directly from heaven,&rdquo; while he, by memorizing his,
forfeited the aid of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I therefore
changed my method,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and took a text without
any premeditation, and endeavored to speak what occurred to me at
the time.&nbsp; If bad before, it was worse now.&nbsp; I had
neither sense nor life, nothing but a poor miserable tone, which
produced no effect upon the hearers, and made me really sick of
myself.&nbsp; I thought God had nothing to do with me as a
preacher.&nbsp; I had no confidence in my own talents and
virtues, and the very sound of my voice discouraged me.&nbsp; I
have since perceived the great goodness of God herein, preserving
me from being puffed up by too good an opinion of my own gifts
and graces, which both before and since has proved fatal to many
young preachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These views of himself often occasioned him deep distress of
mind.&nbsp; He entered the pulpit with dread.&nbsp; He conceived
that the mere sight of him there was sufficient to becloud the
hearts of his hearers, and intercept every ray of light from
heaven.&nbsp; He could not ascertain that he had been the means
of the salvation of a single soul during the five years of his
preaching.&nbsp; It might have been some relief to him, could he
have ventured to develope to some judicious Christian friend the
disquietude of his soul.&nbsp; But this he dared not do, lest he
should be deemed an unconverted man in the ministry, and exposed
as a hypocrite to the world.&nbsp; So he wrapped up the painful
secret in his heart, and drank his wormwood alone.</p>
<p>From all this, what are we to infer?&nbsp; That Mr. Evans had
never been converted, or was not now in favour with God?&nbsp; We
think not.&nbsp; All who knew him had full confidence in his
piety, and thought him an excellent Christian.&nbsp; Whether his
attention to the subject of baptism, or the Calvinistic views he
had recently imbibed, had acted injuriously upon his religious
enjoyment, would be an unprofitable speculation, if not otherwise
improper.&nbsp; Perhaps these distressing doubts were but the
permitted buffetings of Satan, to preserve him from spiritual
pride; the preparatory darkness, which enabled him more highly to
appreciate, and more earnestly to recommend to others, &ldquo;the
Bright and Morning Star.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of
God&rsquo;s chosen servants have been disciplined for their work
in darkness.&nbsp; Dr. Payson, during all the earlier part of his
eminently useful ministry, and John Summerfield, when his sweet
persuasive tongue was leading multitudes to the Cross, were
constantly distressed with doubts of their own spiritual
condition.&nbsp; Though it is certainly the privilege of every
believer to know that he is &ldquo;a new creature in Christ
Jesus,&rdquo; we cannot thence infer that all such as have not
constantly the direct witness of the Spirit are in an
unregenerate state.</p>
<h3>LABORS IN L&Euml;YN.</h3>
<p>In 1790, Mr. Evans attended the Baptist association at
Maesyberllan, in Brecknockshire.&nbsp; Some ministers from North
Wales persuaded him to accompany them on their return.&nbsp; He
found the Baptist people at L&euml;yn, in Caernarvonshire, few
and feeble.&nbsp; They earnestly besought him to remain with
them, to which he at length consented.&nbsp; He was immediately
ordained a missionary, to itinerate among several small churches
in that vicinity.</p>
<p>Now he began emphatically to &ldquo;live by faith on the Son
of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The burden which he had borne so long,
rolled away like that of Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrim.&nbsp; He
received &ldquo;the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of
praise for the spirit of heaviness.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this time,
a wonderous power attended his preaching.&nbsp; Many were
gathered into the church, as the fruit of his labor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I could scarcely believe,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the
testimony of the people, who came before the church as candidates
for membership, that they had been converted through my
ministry.&nbsp; Yet I was obliged to believe, though it was
marvellous in my eyes.&nbsp; This made me thankful to God, and
increased my confidence in prayer.&nbsp; A delightful gale
descended upon me, as from the hill of the New Jerusalem, and I
felt the three great things of the kingdom of heaven,
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the first year of his labors in L&euml;yn, he was
united in marriage to Miss Catherine Jones, a pious young lady of
his own church, and a very suitable companion.&nbsp; After this
event, his duties were increasingly arduous.&nbsp; He frequently
preached five times during the Sabbath, and walked twenty
miles.&nbsp; His heart was full of love, and he spoke with the
ardor of a seraph.&nbsp; Constant <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>labor and intense excitement soon
wore upon his health.&nbsp; He became feeble, and his friends
were apprehensive of consumption.&nbsp; Through the mercy of God,
however, he was spared; gradually recovered his strength; and
performed, through the remainder of a long life, an incredible
amount of ministerial labor.</p>
<h3>VISIT TO SOUTH WALES.</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans naturally felt a strong desire to see his friends in
South Wales.&nbsp; During his second year at L&euml;yn, thinking
it might benefit his enfeebled health, as well as refresh his
spirit, he determined to make them a visit.&nbsp; He was unable
to procure a horse for the journey, and the small societies to
which he preached were too poor to provide him one.&nbsp; So he
set forth on foot, preaching in every town and village through
which he passed.&nbsp; His talents were now developed, and he had
received &ldquo;an unction from the Holy One.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
who heard him were astonished at his power.&nbsp; His old
acquaintances regarded him as a new man.&nbsp; A great awakening
followed him wherever he went.&nbsp; Hear his own
language:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now felt a power in the word, like a hammer breaking
the rock, and not like a rush.&nbsp; I had a very powerful time
at Kilvowyr, and also pleasant meetings in the neighborhood of
Cardigan.&nbsp; The work of conversion was progressing so rapidly
and with so much energy in those parts, that the ordinance of
baptism was administered every month for a year or more, at
Kilvowyr, Cardigan, Blaenywaun, Blaenff&ocirc;s, and Ebenezer, to
from ten to twenty persons each month.&nbsp; The chapels and
adjoining burying-grounds were crowded with hearers of a
week-day, even in the middle of harvest.&nbsp; I frequently
preached in the open air in the evenings, and the rejoicing,
singing, and praising would continue until broad light the next
morning.&nbsp; The hearers appeared melted down in tenderness at
the different meetings, so that they wept streams of tears, and
cried out, in such a manner that one might suppose the whole
congregation, male and female, was thoroughly dissolved by the
gospel.&nbsp; &lsquo;The word of God&rsquo; was now become as
&lsquo;a sharp two-edged sword, dividing asunder the joints and
marrow,&rsquo; and revealing unto the people the secret
corruptions of their hearts.&nbsp; Preaching was now unto me a
pleasure, and the success of the ministry in all places was very
great.&nbsp; The same people attended fifteen or <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>twenty
different meetings, many miles apart, in the counties of
Cardigan, Pembroke, Caermarthen, Glamorgan, Monmouth, and
Brecknock.&nbsp; This revival, especially in the vicinity of
Cardigan, and in Pembrokeshire, subdued the whole country, and
induced people everywhere to think well of religion.&nbsp; The
same heavenly gale followed down to Fishguard, Llangloffan,
Little New-Castle, and Rhydwylim, where Mr. Gabriel Rees was then
a zealous and a powerful preacher.&nbsp; There was such a tender
spirit resting on the hearers at this season, from Tabor to
Middlemill, that one would imagine, by their weeping and
trembling in their places of worship, and all this mingled with
so much heavenly cheerfulness, that they would wish to abide for
ever in this state of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fame of this &ldquo;wonderful work of God&rdquo; spread
through South Wales on the wings of the wind.&nbsp; An
appointment for Christmas Evans to preach was sufficient to
attract thousands to the place.&nbsp; In a very short time he had
acquired greater popularity in Wales than any other minister of
his day.</p>
<h3>SETTLEMENT IN ANGLESEA.</h3>
<p>On Christmas day, when Mr. Evans was forty-six years of age,
he removed from L&euml;yn to the isle of Anglesea.&nbsp;
According to his own account, &ldquo;it was a very rough day of
frost and snow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unencumbered with this world&rsquo;s
goods, and possessing the true apostolic spirit, he
&ldquo;commenced the journey on horseback, with his wife behind
him,&rdquo; and arrived on the evening of the same day at
Llangewin.</p>
<p>Whatever the motive of this removal, it was certainly not the
love of money.&nbsp; His salary in Anglesea was only &pound;17
per annum, and for twenty years he never asked for more.&nbsp; He
had learned, with the apostle, &ldquo;having food and raiment,
therewith to be content.&rdquo;&nbsp; He found his reward in his
work.&nbsp; The privilege of preaching Christ and saving souls,
with him, was preferable to mountains of gold and silver.</p>
<p>On his arrival in Anglesea, he found ten small Baptist
societies, in a lukewarm and distracted condition; himself the
only minister, and no brother to aid him within a hundred and
fifty miles.&nbsp; He commenced his labors in earnest.&nbsp; One
of his first movements was the appointment of a day of fasting
and prayer in all the preaching <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>places.&nbsp; He soon had the
satisfaction to realize an extensive revival, which continued
under his faithful ministry for many years.</p>
<h3>POWERFUL SERMONS.</h3>
<p>In 1794, the South West Baptist Association was held at Velin
Voel, in Caermarthenshire.&nbsp; Mr. Evans was invited, as one of
the preachers on the occasion.&nbsp; It was a journey of about
two hundred miles.&nbsp; He undertook it on foot, with his usual
fortitude, preaching at different places as he went along.&nbsp;
The meeting was to commence with three consecutive sermons, the
last of which was to be preached by Mr. Evans.&nbsp; The service
was out of doors, and the heat was very oppressive.&nbsp; The
first and second sermons were rather tedious, and the hearers
seemed almost stupefied.&nbsp; Mr. Evans arose and began his
sermon.&nbsp; Before he had spoken fifteen minutes, scores of
people were on their feet, some weeping, some praising, some
leaping and clapping their hands for joy.&nbsp; Nor did the
effect end with the discourse.&nbsp; Throughout the evening, and
during the whole night, the voice of rejoicing and prayer was
heard in every direction; and the dawning of the next day,
awaking the few that had fallen asleep through fatigue, only
renewed the heavenly rapture.&nbsp; &ldquo;Job David, the
Socinian,&rdquo; said the preacher afterwards to a friend,
&ldquo;was highly displeased with this American
gale.&rdquo;&nbsp; But all the Socinians in Wales could not
counteract its influence, or frustrate its happy effects.</p>
<p>Mr. Evans continued to visit the associations in South Wales
for many years: and whenever he came, the people flocked by
thousands to hear &ldquo;the one-eyed man of
Anglesea.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was on one of those occasions, and
under circumstances somewhat similar to the above, that he
preached that singularly effective sermon on the demoniac of
Gadara.&nbsp; The meeting had been in progress three days.&nbsp;
Several discourses had been delivered with little or no
effect.&nbsp; Christmas Evans took the stand, and announced as
his text the evangelical account of the demoniac of Gadara.&nbsp;
He described him as a naked man, with flaming eyes, and wild and
fierce gesticulation; full of relentless anger, and subject to
strange paroxysms of rage; the terror and pity of all the
townsfolk.&nbsp; They had bound him with great chains, but he
would break them as Samson broke the withes.&nbsp; They had tried
to soothe him by <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>kindness, but he would leap upon them like a furious
wild beast, or burst away with the speed of a stag, his long hair
streaming on the wind behind him.&nbsp; He inhabited the rocks of
a Jewish cemetery; and when he slept, he laid down in a
tomb.&nbsp; The place was a little out of town, and not far from
the great turnpike road, so that people passing often saw him,
and heard his dreadful lamentations and blasphemies.&nbsp; Nobody
dared to cross his path unarmed, and all the women and children
ran away as soon as they saw him coming.&nbsp; Sometimes he
sallied forth from his dismal abode at midnight, like one risen
from the dead, howling and cursing like a fiend, breaking into
houses, frightening the inhabitants from their beds, and driving
them to seek shelter in the streets and the fields.&nbsp; He had
a broken-hearted wife, and five little children, living about a
mile and a half distant.&nbsp; In his intervals of comparative
calmness, he would set out to visit them.&nbsp; On his way, the
evil spirit would come upon him, and transform the husband and
father instantly into a fury.&nbsp; Then he would run toward the
house, raving like a wounded tiger, and roaring like a lion upon
his prey.&nbsp; He would spring against the door, and shatter it
into fragments; while the poor wife and children fled through the
back door to the neighbors, or concealed themselves in the
cellar.&nbsp; Then he would spoil the furniture, and break all
the dishes, and bound away howling again to his home in the
cemetery.&nbsp; The report of this mysterious and terrible being
had spread through all the surrounding region, and everybody
dreaded and pitied the man among the tombs.&nbsp; Jesus came that
way.&nbsp; The preacher described the interview, the miracle, the
happy change in the sufferer, the transporting surprise of his
long afflicted family.&nbsp; Then, shifting the scene, he showed
his hearers the catastrophe of the swine, the flight of the
affrighted herdsman, his amusing report to his master, and the
effect of the whole upon the populace.&nbsp; All this was done
with such dramatic effect, as to convulse his numerous hearers
with alternate laughter and weeping for more than half an
hour.&nbsp; Having thus elicited an intense interest in the
subject, he proceeded to educe from the narrative several
important doctrines, which he illustrated so forcibly, and urged
so powerfully, that the people first became profoundly serious,
then wept like mourners at a funeral, and finally threw
themselves on the ground, and broke forth in loud prayers for
mercy; and the preacher continued nearly three hours, the effect
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>increasing
till he closed.&nbsp; One who heard that wonderful sermon says,
that, during the first half hour, the people seemed like an
assembly in a theatre, delighted with an amusing play; after
that, like a community in mourning, over some great and good man,
cut off by a sudden calamity; and at last, like the inhabitants
of a city shaken by an earthquake, rushing into the streets,
falling upon the earth, and screaming and calling upon God! <a

class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<h3>SANDEMANIANISM AND SABELLIANISM.</h3>
<p>About this time arose among the Baptists of North Wales a
bitter and distracting controversy, concerning Sandemanianism and
Sabellianism, which had been introduced by the Rev. Mr. Jones, a
man of considerable learning and influence in the
denomination.&nbsp; Mr. Evans was at first inclined to fall in
with these doctrines, and participated largely in the strife of
tongues.&nbsp; He says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sandemanian system affected me so far as to quench
the spirit of prayer for the conversion of sinners, and it
induced in my mind a greater regard for the smaller things of the
kingdom of heaven than for the greater.&nbsp; I lost the strength
which clothed my mind with zeal, confidence, and earnestness in
the pulpit for the conversion of souls to Christ.&nbsp; My heart
retrograded, in a manner, and I could not realize the testimony
of a good conscience.&nbsp; Sabbath nights, after having been in
the day exposing and vilifying with all bitterness the errors
that prevailed, my conscience felt as if displeased, and
reproached me that I had lost nearness to, and walking with
God.&nbsp; It would intimate that something exceedingly precious
was now wanting in me; I would reply, that I was acting in
obedience to the word; but it continued to accuse me of the want
of some precious article.&nbsp; I had been robbed, to a great
degree, of the spirit of prayer and of the spirit of
preaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Evans thus describes the effect of this controversy upon
his people:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sandemanian spirit began to manifest itself in the
counties of Merioneth, Caernarvon, Anglesea, and Denbigh, and the
first visible effect was the subversion of the hearers, for which
the system was peculiarly adapted; intimating, as it did, that to
Babylon the <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>crowd of hearers always belonged.&nbsp; We lost, in
Anglesea, nearly all those who were accustomed to attend with us;
some of them joined other congregations; and, in this way, it
pulled down nearly all that had been built up in twelve or
fifteen years, and made us appear once again a mean and
despicable party in the view of the country.&nbsp; The same
effects followed it in a greater or lesser degree in the other
counties noticed; but its principal station appears to have been
in Merionethshire; this county seems to have been particularly
prepared for its reception, and here it achieved by some means a
sort of supremacy.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>TIME OF REFRESHING</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans had been a long time in this controversy, destitute
of all religious enjoyment, or, to use his own expressive phrase,
&ldquo;as dry as Gilboa,&rdquo; when he experienced a remarkable
refreshing from the presence of the Lord.&nbsp; The following
account is extracted from his journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was weary of a cold heart towards Christ, and his
sacrifice, and the work of his Spirit&mdash;of a cold heart in
the pulpit, in secret prayer, and in the study.&nbsp; For fifteen
years previously, I had felt my heart burning within, as if going
to Emmaus with Jesus.&nbsp; On a day ever to be remembered by me,
as I was going from Dolgelley to Machynlleth, and climbing up
towards Cadair Idris, I considered it to be incumbent upon me to
pray, however hard I felt my heart, and however worldly the frame
of my spirit was.&nbsp; Having begun in the name of Jesus, I soon
felt as it were the fetters loosening, and the old hardness of
heart softening, and, as I thought, mountains of frost and snow
dissolving and melting within me.&nbsp; This engendered
confidence in my soul in the promise of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; I
felt my whole mind relieved from some great bondage: tears flowed
copiously, and I was constrained to cry out for the gracious
visits of God, by restoring to my soul the joy of his
salvation;&mdash;and that he would visit the churches in
Anglesea, that were under my care.&nbsp; I embraced in my
supplications all the churches of the saints, and nearly all the
ministers in the principality by their names.&nbsp; This struggle
lasted for three hours: it rose again and again, like one wave
after another, or a high flowing tide, driven by a strong wind,
until my nature became faint by weeping and crying.&nbsp; Thus I
resigned <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>myself to Christ, body and soul, gifts and
labors&mdash;all my life&mdash;every day and every hour that
remained for me;&mdash;and all my cares I committed to
Christ.&mdash;The road was mountainous and lonely, and I was
wholly alone, and suffered no interruption in my wrestlings with
God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this time, I was made to expect the goodness of
God to churches and to myself.&nbsp; Thus the Lord delivered me
and the people of Anglesea from being carried away by the flood
of Sandemanianism.&nbsp; In the first religious meetings after
this, I felt as if I had been removed from the cold and sterile
regions of spiritual frost, into the verdant fields of the divine
promises.&nbsp; The former striving with God in prayer, and the
longing anxiety for the conversion of sinners, which I had
experienced at L&euml;yn, was now restored.&nbsp; I had a hold of
the promises of God.&nbsp; The result was, when I returned home,
the first thing that arrested my attention was, that the Spirit
was working also in the brethren in Anglesea, inducing in them a
spirit of prayer, especially in two of the deacons, who were
particularly importunate that God would visit us in mercy, and
render the word of his grace effectual amongst us for the
conversion of sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>COVENANT WITH GOD.</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans now entered into a solemn covenant with God, made,
as he says, &ldquo;under a deep sense of the evil of his heart,
and in dependence upon the infinite grace and merit of the
Redeemer.&rdquo;&nbsp; This interesting article is preserved
among his papers.&nbsp; We give it entire, as a specimen of his
spirit and his faith:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I give my soul and body unto thee, Jesus, the
true God, and everlasting life&mdash;deliver me from sin, and
from eternal death, and bring me into life everlasting.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call the day, the sun, the earth, the
trees, the stones, the bed, the table, and the books, to witness
that I come unto thee.&nbsp; Redeemer of sinners, that I may
obtain rest for my soul from the thunders of guilt and the dread
of eternity.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do, through confidence in thy power,
earnestly entreat thee to take the work into thine own hand, and
give me a circumcised heart, that I may love thee, and create in
me a right spirit, that I may seek thy glory.&nbsp; Grant me that
principle which thou <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>wilt own in the day of judgment, that
I may not then assume palefacedness, and find myself a
hypocrite.&nbsp; Grant me this, for the sake of thy most precious
blood.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; &ldquo;I entreat thee, Jesus, the Son of God, in
power, grant me, for the sake of thy agonizing death, a
covenant-interest in thy blood, which cleanseth; in thy
righteousness, which justifieth; and in thy redemption, which
delivereth.&nbsp; I entreat an interest in thy blood, for thy
<i>blood&rsquo;s</i> sake, and a part in thee, for thy
name&rsquo;s sake, which thou hast given among men.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, take,
for the sake of thy cruel death, my time, and strength, and the
gifts and talents I possess; which, with a full purpose of heart,
I consecrate to thy glory in the building up of thy church in the
world, for thou art worthy of the hearts and talents of all
men.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; &ldquo;I desire thee, my great High Priest, to
confirm, by thy power, from thy High Court, my usefulness as a
preacher, and my piety as a Christian, as two gardens nigh to
each other; that sin may not have place in my heart, to becloud
my confidence in thy righteousness, and that I may not be left to
any foolish act that may occasion my gifts to wither, and
rendered useless before my life ends.&nbsp; Keep thy gracious eye
upon me, and watch over me, O my Lord, and my God for ever!&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; &ldquo;I give myself in a particular manner to
thee, O Jesus Christ, the Saviour, to be preserved from the falls
into which many stumble, that thy name (in thy cause) may not be
blasphemed or wounded, that my peace may not be injured, that thy
people may not be grieved, and that thine enemies may not be
hardened.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come unto thee, beseeching thee to be in
covenant with me in my ministry.&nbsp; As thou didst prosper
Bunyan, Vavasor Powell, Howell Harris, Rowlands, and Whitefield,
O do thou prosper me.&nbsp; Whatsoever things are opposed to my
prosperity, remove them out of the way.&nbsp; Work in me every
thing approved of God, for the attainment of this.&nbsp; Give me
a heart &lsquo;sick of love&rsquo; to thyself, and to the souls
of men.&nbsp; Grant that I may experience the power of thy word
before I deliver it, as Moses felt the power of his own rod,
before he saw it on the land and waters of Egypt.&nbsp; Grant
this, for the sake of thine infinitely precious blood, O Jesus,
my hope, and my all in all!&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>IX.&nbsp; &ldquo;Search me now, and lead me in plain
paths of judgment.&nbsp; Let me discover in this life what I am
before thee, that I may not find myself of another character,
when I am shown in the light of the immortal world, and open my
eyes in all the brightness of eternity.&nbsp; Wash me in thy
redeeming blood.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>X.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant me strength to depend upon thee for food
and raiment, and to make known my requests.&nbsp; O let thy care
be over me as a covenant-privilege betwixt thee and myself, and
not like a general care to feed the ravens that perish, and
clothe the lily that is cast into the oven; but let thy care be
over me as one of thy family, as one of thine unworthy
brethren.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XI.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant, O Jesus! and take upon thyself the
preparing of me for death, for thou art God; there is no need,
but for thee to speak the word.&nbsp; If possible, thy will be
done; leave me not long in affliction, nor to die suddenly,
without bidding adieu to my brethren, and let me die in their
sight, after a short illness.&nbsp; Let all things be ordered
against the day of removing from one world to another, that there
be no confusion nor disorder, but a quiet discharge in
peace.&nbsp; O grant me this, for the sake of thine agony in the
garden!&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XII.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant, O blessed Lord! that nothing may grow
and be matured in me, to occasion thee to cast me off from the
service of the sanctuary, like the sons of Eli; and for the sake
of thine unbounded merit, let not my days be longer than my
usefulness.&nbsp; O let me not be like lumber in a house in the
end of my days,&mdash;in the way of others to work.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XIII.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beseech thee, O Redeemer! to present
these my supplications before the Father: and O! inscribe them in
thy book with thine own immortal pen, while I am writing them
with my mortal hand, in my book on earth.&nbsp; According to the
depths of thy merit, thine undiminished grace, and thy
compassion, and thy manner unto thy people, O! attach thy name,
in thine upper court, to these unworthy petitions; and set thine
amen to them, as I do on my part of the covenant.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Christmas Evans</span>,
Llangevni, Anglesea, April 10, 18&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Evans, in speaking of this solemn transaction and its
influence upon his spirit, subsequently observes: &ldquo;I felt a
sweet peace and tranquility of soul, like unto a poor man that
had been brought under the protection of the royal family, and
had an annual settlement <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>for life made upon him; from whose
dwelling the painful dread of poverty and want had been for ever
banished away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus &ldquo;strengthened with might in the inner man,&rdquo;
he labored with renewed energy and zeal, and showers of blessings
descended upon his labors.&nbsp; In two years, his ten preaching
places in Anglesea were increased to twenty, and six hundred
converts were added to the church under his care.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The wilderness and solitary place were glad for them, and
the desert rejoiced and blossomed as the rose.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>STUDYING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans made several visits to Liverpool, Bristol, and other
parts of England.&nbsp; On these occasions he was frequently
solicited to preach in English, to which he several times
consented, to the great gratification of his English
friends.&nbsp; These sermons evinced the same energy of thought,
and the same boldness of imagery, as those which he preached in
Welsh; but in the power of his peculiar delivery, they were
inevitably far inferior.&nbsp; His brethren in England were much
delighted with his performances, and said it was &ldquo;no wonder
the Welsh were warm under such preaching;&rdquo; but his language
was broken and hesitating, and they could scarcely have any
conception of his animation and energy when he spoke in his
vernacular tongue.</p>
<p>His success induced him to commence a systematic study of the
English language, that he might be able to preach in it with
greater freedom and effect.&nbsp; He could read English before,
and was somewhat familiar with the best English authors of his
day; but never acquainted himself with the grammar of the
language till he was thirty-three years of age.&nbsp; But read
his own account of the matter:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English brethren had prevailed upon me to preach to
them in broken English, as it was; this induced me to set about
the matter in earnest, making it a subject of prayer, for the aid
of the Spirit, that I might be in some measure a blessing to the
English friends, for there appeared some sign that God now called
me to this department of labor in his service.&nbsp; I never
succeeded in any thing for the good of others, without making it
a matter of prayer.&nbsp; My English preaching was very broken
and imperfect in point of language; yet, through the grace of
Jesus Christ, it was made in <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>some degree useful at Liverpool,
Bristol, and some other places.&nbsp; I was about forty years old
when I learned to read the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Testament,
and use Parkhurst&rsquo;s Lexicons in both languages.&nbsp; I
found that, had I studied the English language attentively and
perseveringly, I should be able to overcome great difficulties;
and also, that I could without much labor in the course of few
years, even in my idle hours, as it were, understand all the
Hebrew words corresponding with every Welsh word in the Bible;
and so also the Greek.&nbsp; I had always before thought that it
was impossible to accomplish this, for I had no one to encourage
me in the undertaking; but I found it was practicable, and proved
it in some measure, yet relinquished the pursuit on account of my
advanced age.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>NEW TROUBLES AND SORROWS.</h3>
<p>Here we pass over several years of Mr. Evans&rsquo; history,
during which nothing of very special interest occurred, except
the agitation of the Fullerian controversy.&nbsp; This is a
matter which requires only a passing notice in this brief
memoir.&nbsp; We let it sleep in silence.</p>
<p>Mr. Evans was now nearly sixty years of age.&nbsp; Infirmity,
the result of his arduous labors and numerous afflictions, began
to prey upon his system.&nbsp; The several congregations under
his care had hitherto constituted but one church.&nbsp; But the
number of preaching places had now become too great for him, in
his enfeebled state, to continue his pastoral visits and labors
among them as he had done.&nbsp; He therefore advised them to
form themselves into separate churches, two or three stations
uniting in one.&nbsp; This was the occasion of a dark and
dreadful storm upon the apostle of Anglesea.&nbsp; Some of the
churches refused the ministers he recommended, and called others
whom he disapproved.&nbsp; Then arose a bitter party spirit, and
a general contention, among the congregations.&nbsp; Mr. Evans
was severely censured, and even assailed with the shafts of
slander.&nbsp; Many of his former friends forsook him, and some
of those who professed to feel for him in his troubles did
nothing for his vindication.&nbsp; The severity of these public
calamities was increased by private afflictions.&nbsp; His
beloved wife had gone &ldquo;the way of all the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was himself brought very low by sickness,
in which <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>he nearly lost his only remaining eye, and seemed fast
tending to his final home.</p>
<p>But though cast down, he was not destroyed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wonder greatly,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that I did not sink into
the grave under the weight of sorrows that came upon me in my old
age, together with an accumulation of trials of all kinds; but
the Lord sustained me.&nbsp; There was, in the midst of all, a
strong persuasion in my mind, that there was yet much work for me
to do for God in the world, as well as much to suffer, ere I
died.&nbsp; If I only entered the pulpit, I felt raised as it
were to Paradise&mdash;above my afflictions&mdash;until I forgot
my adversity; yea, I felt my mountain strong, my mind was in such
a heavenly frame, and as anxious as ever for the conversion of
sinners.&nbsp; The truth appeared to me in its power like a
hammer in its strength.&nbsp; The doctrine dropped as sweet as
the honey, yea, sweeter than the honeycomb, and as comfortable as
the best wine.&nbsp; I was now particularly wishful that all the
ministers in Anglesea should join with me, according to the
promise, &lsquo;If two of you agree to ask the <i>same thing</i>,
it shall be given unto you of my Father which is in
heaven;&rsquo; for I had such confidence that then I should see
prosperity attending the ministry, and that I should not die
until I had finished my work.&nbsp; I said to a
brother:&mdash;&lsquo;Brother, the doctrine, the confidence, and
strength which I feel, will make some persons dance with joy yet
in some parts of Wales.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yea, brother,&rsquo;
said he, with tears flowing in streams from his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every thing now contributed to remove me from
Anglesea.&nbsp; The unbending disposition of those who were
offended at me, and the ardor of my own spirit, believing that
there was work for me to do in some other field of the harvest of
the Son of man, and my having prayed earnestly for twelve months
for the direction of Divine Providence, together with the visions
of my head in the night seasons, appeared to unite together to
lead in one direction.&nbsp; At length, the determination to
leave Anglesea, afflicted as I was, preponderated.&nbsp; I was
much like Jacob, leaving his father and his mother, going with
his staff only over Jordan: so was I, leaving the church: I had
prayed, yea, I had striven with God for its prosperity, and had
labored nearly forty years with it&mdash;now leaving
it&mdash;possessing nothing of this world&rsquo;s goods, save the
horse upon which I rode, and a small amount of silver in my
pocket; and scarcely could I say that these were mine.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>LEGAL
PROSECUTION.</h3>
<p>During the above-mentioned tribulations he received an
insulting letter, threatening him with a civil prosecution.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They talk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of casting me into a
court of law, where I have never been, and hope I shall never go;
but I will cast them first into the court of Jesus Christ, the
source of law and authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he retired
to his chamber, and falling upon his knees, he wept and made
supplication in the following pathetic strain:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O blessed Lord! in thy merit I confide, and trust to be
heard.&nbsp; Lord, some of my brethren have run wild; and
forgetting their duty and obligations to their father in the
gospel, they threaten me with the law of the land.&nbsp; Weaken,
I beseech thee, their designs in this, as thou didst wither the
arm of Jeroboam; and soften them, as thou didst soften the mind
of Esau, and disarmed him of his warlike temper against thy
servant Jacob, after the wrestling at Penuel.&nbsp; So disarm
them, for I do not know the length of Satan&rsquo;s chain in this
case, and in this unbrotherly attack.&nbsp; But thou canst
shorten the chain as short as it may please thee.&nbsp; Lord, I
anticipate them in point of law.&nbsp; They think of casting
thine unworthy servant into the little courts here below; but I
cast my cause into the High Court, in which thou, gracious Jesus,
art the High Chancellor.&nbsp; Receive thou the cause of thine
unworthy servant, and send them a writ or a notice
immediately&mdash;sending into their conscience, and summoning
them to consider what they are doing.&nbsp; O, frighten them with
a summons from thy court, until they come and bow in contrition
at thy feet; and take from their hands every revengeful weapon,
and make them deliver up every gun of scandal, and every sword of
bitter words, and every spear of slanderous expressions, and
surrender them all at thy cross.&nbsp; Forgive them all their
faults, and clothe them with white robes, and give them oil for
their heads, and the organ, and the harp of ten strings, to sing,
for the trampling of Satan under our feet by the God of
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus poured out his heart to God, he felt some
confidence of security.&nbsp; But he was never satisfied in such
cases without an inward assurance of acceptance and
success.&nbsp; So he went again and again; and when, like Jesus,
he had &ldquo;offered up many prayers, with strong crying and
tears,&rdquo; like Jacob &ldquo;he had power <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>with God, and
prevailed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At the seventh time,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;I came down in full confidence that Christ had taken
my cause into his own hand, and would be my Savior.&nbsp; I felt
as cheerful and happy as Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrim, when his load
fell off and rolled into the grave of Christ; or as Naaman, when
he came up from the waters of Jordan, cured of his
leprosy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to add, the threat was never
executed.&nbsp; The Throne of Grace is the good man&rsquo;s sure
resort in every emergency.&nbsp; Jehovah &ldquo;hides him in his
pavilion from the strife of tongues.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CAERPHILLY.</h3>
<p>An invitation, which he received about this time, to take
charge of the Baptist church in Caerphilly, Glamorganshire, South
Wales, confirmed Mr. Evans in his determination to leave the
scene of his recent trials.&nbsp; He set out alone, in his
sixtieth year.&nbsp; The distance he had to travel was about two
hundred miles.&nbsp; On the way, while dwelling on his past
misfortunes, he found his heart melted within him, and drawn out
in fervent prayer.&nbsp; His faith soon triumphed over his
afflictions and his fears.&nbsp; He renewed his covenant with
God, and went on his way rejoicing.&nbsp; This revival of his
religious feelings had a powerful effect upon his ministry.&nbsp;
He had not been long in Caerphilly, before the Spirit of God was
poured copiously upon the people.</p>
<p>Previous to this time of refreshing, he had a remarkable
dream, which he noted in his diary.&nbsp; He thought he was in
the church at Caerphilly, and found many harps hanging about the
pulpit, wrapped in coverings of green.&nbsp; Then, said he,
&ldquo;I will take down the harps of heaven in this
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; In removing the covering, he found the ark of
the covenant, inscribed with the name of Jehovah.&nbsp; Then he
cried, &ldquo;Brethren, the Lord has come to us, according to his
promise, and in answer to our prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that very
place, he shortly afterward had the satisfaction of receiving one
hundred and forty converts into the church, as the fruit of his
ministry.</p>
<p>While at Caerphilly, he entered into a second marriage.&nbsp;
He remained there only two years.&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;I never
spent a short time in greater comfort, for the ark of God had
appeared there, and the harps of one hundred and forty souls had
been tuned to the song <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>of redemption.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happy
years no doubt they were, and gladly would Mr. Evans have ended
his life in Caerphilly; but troubles arose between him and some
of his parishioners, and, receiving a call from Cardiff, a
neighboring town, he went to take charge of a church in that
place.</p>
<h3>ANOTHER COVENANT.</h3>
<p>Previous to his removal, and while he was meditating the
matter, he made a new covenant with God.&nbsp; We extract again
from his journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While returning from a place called Tongwynl&acirc;s
over Caerphilly mountain, the spirit of prayer descended very
copiously upon me.&nbsp; I wept for some hours, and heartily
supplicated Jesus Christ, for the blessings here following.&nbsp;
I found at this time a particular nearness to Christ, as if he
were close by me, and my mind was filled with strong confidence
that he attended to my requests, for the sake of the merits of
his own name.&nbsp; This decided in favor of Cardiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant me the great favor of being led by thee,
according to thy will&mdash;by the directions of thy providence
and word, and the disposing of my own mind by thy Spirit, for the
sake of thine infinitely precious blood.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C.
E.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant, if I am to leave Caerphilly, that the
gale (of the Spirit&rsquo;s influence) and religious revival I
had there may follow me to Cardiff, for the sake of thy great
name.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant thy blessing upon bitter things, to
brighten, and quicken me more and more, and not to depress and
render me more lifeless.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suffer me not to be trodden under the proud
feet of members, or deacons, for the sake of thy goodness.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant me the invaluable favor of being, in
thine hand, the means of calling sinners unto thyself, and of
edifying thy saints, wherever thou wilt send me, for the sake of
thy name.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I am to stay at Caerphilly, give me some
tokens, as to Gideon of old, by removing the things that
discourage me, and are in the way of the prosperity of religion
in that church.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant, Lord of glory, and Head of thy
church, that the Ark of the cause which is thine, in Anglesea and
Caerphilly, may <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>be sustained from falling into the hands of the
Philistines.&nbsp; Do not reject it.&nbsp; Aid it speedily, and
lift up the light of thy countenance upon it; and by thy Spirit,
word, and providence, so operate as to carry things forward in
the churches, and neighborhoods, in such a manner as will produce
changes in officers, and measures that will accomplish a thorough
improvement in the great cause, for the establishment of which in
the world thou hast died;&mdash;and by scattering those that
delight in war, and closing the mouths of those that occasion
confusion.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant me way-tokens by the time I begin my
journey to Liverpool, and from thence to Anglesea, if it is thy
will that I should go thither this year.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C.
E.</p>
<p>IX.&nbsp; &ldquo;O grant me succor beneath the shadow of the
sympathy that is in thee towards them who are tempted, and the
unbounded power there is in thee to be the relief of such.&nbsp;
Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>X.&nbsp; &ldquo;Accept of my thanksgiving a hundred millions
of times, that thou hast not hitherto cast me from thine hand, as
a darkened star, or a vessel in which there is no pleasure; and
suffer not my life to be extended beyond my usefulness.&nbsp;
Thanks, that thou hast not given me a prey to the teeth of
any.&nbsp; Blessed be thy name.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XI.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the sake of thine infinite merit, do not
cast me, thy servant, under the feet of pride and injustice, of
<i>worldly</i> greatness, riches, and selfish oppression of any
men, but hide me in the secret of thy tabernacle from the strife
of tongues.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XII.&nbsp; &ldquo;Help me to wait silently and patiently upon
thee, for the fulfilment of these things, and not become enraged,
angry, and speak unadvisedly with my lips, like Moses, the
servant of the Lord.&nbsp; Sustain my heart from sinking, to wait
for fresh strength from Zion.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XIII.&nbsp; &ldquo;Help me to wait upon thee for the
necessaries of life; let thy mercy and goodness follow me while I
live; and, as it hath pleased thee to honor me greatly, by the
blessing thou hast vouchsafed upon the ministry through me, as an
humble instrument, at Caerphilly, after the great storm had
beaten upon me in Anglesea, like Job, grant that this honor may
continue to follow me the remainder of my days, as thou didst
unto thy servant Job.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XIV.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let this covenant abide like the covenant of
salt, until I <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>come to thee in the world of eternal light.&nbsp; I
entreat aid to resign myself to thee, and to thy will.&nbsp; I
beseech thee take my heart, and inscribe upon it a deep reverence
of thyself, with an inscription that time and eternity cannot
efface.&nbsp; O let the remainder of my sermons be taken by thee
from my lips; and those which I write, let them be unto thee for
a praise.&nbsp; Unto thee I dedicate them.&nbsp; If there should
be any thing in them conducive to thy glory, and to the service
of thy kingdom, do thou preserve it, and reveal it unto men;
else, let it die like the drop of a bucket in the midst of the
scorching heat of Africa.&nbsp; O grant, that there may be a drop
of that water which thou alone canst impart, and which springs up
to eternal life, running through all my sermons.&nbsp; In this
covenant, which probably is the last that will be written between
me and thee on the earth, I commit myself, my wife, and the
churches amongst whom I have preached, to the protection of thy
grace, and the care of thy covenant.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;C. E.</p>
<p>XV.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let this covenant continue when I am in
sickness or in health, or in any other circumstance; for thou
hast overcome the world, fulfilled the law, finished justifying
righteousness, and hast swallowed up death in victory, and all
power in heaven and earth is in thine hand.&nbsp; For the sake of
thy most precious blood and perfect righteousness, note this
covenant with thine own blood in the court of the memorials of
forgiving mercy: attach unto it thy name in which I believe; and
here I, this day, set my unworthy name unto it, with my mortal
hand.&nbsp; Amen.&mdash;Christmas Evans.&nbsp; Dated, Cardiff,
April 24, 1829.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CARDIFF.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;After having entered into this covenant,&rdquo; says
Mr. Evans in his diary, &ldquo;I came to Cardiff, heartily and
unhesitatingly, like a merchant that should send his vessel to
sea after it had been registered in the insurance office.&nbsp; I
had nothing now to lose, for I had given myself up to the
possession of Jesus, the Mediator of the New Testament, for time
and for eternity; and so I have had to abide here in the secret
of his tabernacle for these nine months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He removed to Cardiff in the autumn of 1828, and remained
there two years and a half.&nbsp; During this time, he received
into the church about eighty converts.&nbsp; He was much in
secret prayer, and enjoyed <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>intimate communion with his
God.&nbsp; He not only retired for devotion several times every
day, but ordinarily rose at midnight to call upon the Lord.&nbsp;
But the whole period of his residence was not a cloudless
day.&nbsp; Some unpleasant matters arose in the church, which
caused him much sorrow, as is evident from the following entry in
his diary:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;April 27, 1829.&nbsp; I earnestly entreat thee, blessed
Jesus, for the sake of thine own name, to regard me in this
request. * * * * Let things be ordered, O Lord, that they may not
be impediments and discouragements unto me, and a hinderance to
the progress of religion.&nbsp; O, interpose between me and these
obstacles, O Lord, that I may have no occasion to dispute with
any, and so embitter my spirit!&nbsp; Thy power is infinite, and
thy wisdom is infallible.&nbsp; Stand thou between me and all
contention, that no ill effect come upon me.&nbsp; I flee to hide
myself under the shadow of thy wings.&nbsp; Permit nothing to
blunt the edge of my talents, my zeal, or my success,&mdash;nor
corrupt the church.&nbsp; Grant me this for the sake of thine
infinitely precious blood.&nbsp; Set thy name to this request in
the court of heaven, and let Satan&rsquo;s party grow weaker and
weaker, and the cause of truth and righteousness become like the
house of David, and the house of David like the angel of the
Lord.&nbsp; Deliver me, that my spirit be not irritated, and I
speak unadvisedly with my lips, as Moses did.&nbsp; Hide me in
thy pavilion from the strife of tongues * * * *.&nbsp; I am as it
were on the verge of eternity; O save and preserve me by thy
boundless power.&nbsp; Amen, Amen, Amen.&nbsp; Lord, regard,
behold, hear, and spare.&mdash;Christmas Evans.&nbsp; Write this
in thy book, O my Lord, and my God.&nbsp; Let none be
disappointed that wait upon thee, gracious Lord.&mdash;Remember
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He adds in another passage:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given my soul anew to Christ; my body; my
talents; my influence in preaching; my name; my character as a
man, as a Christian, and as a preacher of the gospel; my time,
and the remnant of my opportunities; my success; my peace and
comfort as a Christian and a minister.&nbsp; I have resigned all
afresh into the hands of Christ.&nbsp; I have commended to his
care, also, my wife, and all the circumstances of my family, and
my friends and assistants in the work of the Lord, for whom I
pray earnestly that they may be blessed, throughout Anglesea,
Caernarvon, Caerphilly, Cardiff, and indeed in all the counties
of Wales.&nbsp; There are many of them who <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>were helpers
to me in my day.&nbsp; I will say, in the language of Paul, and I
hope with affectionate emotions of love to Jesus Christ,
&lsquo;The Lord grant unto them that they may find mercy of the
Lord in that day.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is a great privilege to a
minister to retain beloved friends, who have helped him with
their prayers and sympathy.&nbsp; O bless those whom I have, and
preserve the new race, the new generation of them that I have
found in these parts.&nbsp; I committed to God, also, those who
obstruct the progress of the cause here, and disturb the unity
and brotherly love of the church.&nbsp; Let Christ, whose the
church is, and let not me, remove every obstacle, either by
changing and melting in the love of the gospel, or taking them
somewhere else, where they shall not be a curse and an impediment
to the cause&mdash;and by the means that shall seem fit in his
sight.&nbsp; A word or a nod of thine shuts and opens heaven and
earth, and all the locks of the land of <i>Hades</i>, or the
invisible state.&nbsp; For the sake of the blood of thy covenant,
grant the above things unto me, thine unworthy
servant.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>SERMONS FOR THE PRESS.</h3>
<p>During his sojourn at Cardiff, though now sixty-five years
old, much debilitated, and almost blind, he wrote about two
hundred sermons for the press, many of which have since been
published.&nbsp; It is certainly very remarkable, that he should
write, at his advanced age, with all the vigor and vivacity of
his earlier years.&nbsp; Perhaps, of all the sermons he ever
made, those composed at Cardiff are the best.&nbsp; Most of them
were preached on the Sabbath, and written out during the
following week.&nbsp; This circumstance, with their
author&rsquo;s peculiar nearness to God, may account for their
freshness and power.</p>
<p>Mr. Evans was in the habit of referring every important matter
to God.&nbsp; We find in his diary the following
paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cardiff, February 2, 1829.&nbsp; Lord, I have been
importuned by many of my brethren in the ministry, to prepare a
number of my sermons, that have been in the course of my ministry
the most useful in thine hand for the conversion of sinners, with
a view to publication.&nbsp; I had no time when in Anglesea to
engage in the work, because my circumstances required so much
travelling every week.&nbsp; I left the work to lie by, the two
years I was at Caerphilly; but here, at Cardiff, I have had a new
impulse in my thoughts to <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>enter upon it; and I come unto thee,
my great Lord, to consult thee, who art the Head of the church,
and the Head-Prophet and Teacher of thy people.&nbsp; Shall I
proceed with the work or not?&nbsp; Is it a part of my duty, or
is it a useless, foolish notion of my own?&nbsp; I entreat thy
gracious direction in this matter, for the sake of thy great
name.&nbsp; Suffer me not to afflict myself, when my eyesight is
so weak, with a work that thou wilt not bless, but which shall be
buried in the land of forgetfulness.&nbsp; If thou wilt not open
a door&mdash;with thee are the keys of the house of
David&mdash;in thy providence, that I may obtain subscribers, and
bring the work through the press, without hazarding myself in
such a way as will involve me in debt and disgrace: and also if
thou, the great feeder of the flock, wilt not direct me to give
the true gospel, not only without error, but with the savor and
unction which accompanies the works of Bunyan and others, which
thy Spirit is likely to make use of whilst thou hast churches in
Wales: if they should not be for thy glory in the building up of
thy church, and the calling of sinners,&mdash;if these objects
should not be accomplished by the publication of the sermons,
dispose my mind to relinquish the undertaking.&nbsp; But if thou
wilt patronise the work, strengthen me to accomplish the
design.&nbsp; Lord, thou knowest I feel my own insufficiency for
such an important enterprise, and my unworthiness to solicit of
thee such a favor: but I cannot refrain from making these
requests: therefore, for the sake of thine infinite merits,
according to thy manner unto thy people, grant unto me my
request.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>WELSH JUMPING.</h3>
<p>In the autumn of 1829, Mr. Evans wrote in his diary extensive
notes of a conversation which he had with several ministers in
Bristol, on &ldquo;the manner of religious rejoicing so
remarkable among the Welsh.&rdquo;&nbsp; His friends condemned it
in a sweeping sentence, under the name of &ldquo;Welsh
jumping.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Evans attempted its vindication.&nbsp;
We insert his own account:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I observed that I could find no account of it among the
Welsh until the time of Harris and Rowlands, Calvinistic
Methodists, who flourished in Wales about the same time as
Whitefield and Wesley in England.&nbsp; The preaching of these
men was the means of producing a religious revival throughout all
the principality, which had <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>sunk into a state of deep lethargy,
since the time of the great awakening under Vavasor Powell, about
one hundred years before.&nbsp; At this period nothing was to be
seen in almost every parish but young men and young women
flocking together into the churches and church-yards, and
engaging in different gambols and pastimes, such as ball-playing,
foot-ball, leaping, fighting, and such like frolics, as if Wales
had been changed into an Olympic mountain, and old paganism
restored again.&nbsp; It is true, there were some preachers and
churches, both Congregationalists and Baptists, then existing in
the principality; but their talents, their spirits, or their
magnanimity could not storm such a fortress of impiety.&nbsp;
And, besides, there was a dreadful prejudice still remaining in
the country against all sects, since the days of Charles II.; and
they suffered persecution even unto blood, for about one hundred
years previous to the appearing of these men.&nbsp; But from the
ashes of those sufferers the revival by Harris and Rowlands
sprung up, as did Luther from the ashes of Huss and Jerome of
Prague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rowlands and Mr. Harris were both of the communion
of the Episcopal church, and, as such, there was not so much
enmity against them at first; but after they had come out, and
when the people understood that they were preachers of the cross
of Christ, considerable persecution arose against them from the
multitude; but it was now too late&mdash;for the gates of the
city were opened&mdash;the leaven was put in the meal&mdash;the
fire had been kindled&mdash;the sword was drawn from the
scabbard, and many had been wounded, (spiritually,) and were
ready to open the door for the gospel in spite of every
danger.&nbsp; Harris, Rowlands, and the two Williams&rsquo;s, had
been clothed with power from on high, and the hammer of their
ministry was sufficiently heavy to break in pieces the northern
iron. <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a>&nbsp; Several laymen of powerful minds
were also raised up about this time; such as Mr. David Morris,
and others, who were valuable auxiliaries to carry on the
work.&nbsp; By their ministry, this praising and jumping in
religious enjoyment began in Wales, which has not wholly left it
on certain occasions until this day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an apology for them, granting at the same time the
possibility of extremes even in a good cause in the present
state; and that graceless persons may feel something from these
excitements <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>as of the powers of the world to come, in the miraculous
gifts of the Holy Ghost in the apostolic age; observe,</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; That it appears to me like the residue of the
Spirit, and the powers of the world to come; which were necessary
to open a way for the gospel through the darkness and obduracy of
paganism in the days of the apostles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; It is no argument of importance against it,
that many graceless persons felt a considerable degree of
influence at the time, as well as others; for so it was in the
case of Saul, king of Israel, and some besides named in
Scripture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; There is no essential difference between
religious enjoyment in Wales and that which is now experienced in
America; and that which accompanied the preaching of Whitefield
in England, and even in Scotland: and that which also followed
the ministry of President Edwards, in America, when whole towns
and neighborhoods echoed with the sound of persons praying and
praising God, as if a bursting cloud-shower of the Spirit of
grace and prayer had descended upon them.&nbsp; Persons under the
ministry of Whitefield wept, cried for mercy, and even fainted by
the power of this influence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; And such gracious influences are necessary for
the spread of the gospel in every country, and in every land: and
therefore the Millennium is described in the Bible as a period
remarkable for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost&mdash;&lsquo;that
a nation shall be born at once,&rsquo; <a
name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a>&mdash;and &lsquo;the flowing of the
nations shall be to the mountain of the Lord&rsquo;s
house.&rsquo; <a name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a>&nbsp; It is this influence that has
driven, as it were, the gospel into every nook of the mountains
of Wales, as well as into its cities, towns, and villages; while
in England, with all the advantages of education, the gospel, in
a manner, is hid in a corner; and it has not run through the
country, and searched out, and taken possession of all the inland
parts of that spiritual Africa, and that for the want of these
gales of divine influence, and powers peculiar to the gospel: and
it can never be spread through every part of England as it is in
Wales without these gifts.&nbsp; Common preaching will not do to
rouse sluggish districts from the heavy slumbers into which they
are sunk.&nbsp; Indeed, formal prayers and lifeless sermons are
like bulwarks raised against these things in <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>England; and
this evil genius has also entered the principality under the
pretence of order.&nbsp; Five or six stanzas will be sung as dry
as Gilboa, instead of one or two verses, like a new song, full of
God, of Christ, and the Spirit of grace, until the heart is
attuned for worship.&nbsp; The burying-grounds are kept in fine
order in Glamorganshire, and green shrubs and herbs grow on the
graves, but all this is of little value, for the inhabitants of
them are all dead&mdash;so is every form of godliness where its
power is not felt.&nbsp; Order without life is exceedingly
worthless.&nbsp; You exhibit all the character of human nature,
leaving every bud of the flower to open in the beams of the sun,
except in divine worship.&nbsp; On other occasions you appear to
have as much fire in your affections as the Welsh have.&nbsp; If
you are noticed in a court of law, the most efficient advocate,
such as Erskine, will give you the greatest satisfaction; but you
are contented with a preacher, speaking so lifelessly and so low
that you can hardly understand the third part of what he says;
and you will call this decency in the sanctuary.&nbsp; To-morrow,
I shall see you answering fully to the human character, in your
own actions.&nbsp; When the speakers on the platform will be
urging the claims of missions, you will then beat the boards, and
manifest so much life and cheerfulness, that not one of you will
be seen to take up a note-book, nor any other book, while the
speaker shall be addressing you.&nbsp; A Welshman might suppose,
by hearing your noise, that he had been silently conveyed to the
midst of one of the meetings of the &lsquo;Welsh jumpers,&rsquo;
with this difference, that you would perceive many more tears
shed, and hear more &lsquo;calves of the lips&rsquo; <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> offered up, in the rejoicing meetings
of Wales.&nbsp; But you will use your heels well on such
occasions, and a little of your tongues.&nbsp; But even in Wales,
in certain places&mdash;that is, places where the fervent gales
are not enjoyed which fill persons with fear and terror and joy
in approaching the altar of God&mdash;you may see, while hearing
a sermon, one looking into his hymn-book, another into his
note-book, and a third turning over the leaves of his Bible, as
if he were going to study a sermon in the sanctuary, instead of
attending to what is spoken by the preacher as the mouth of
God.&nbsp; If there is joy and gladness pertaining to many, the
light of God&rsquo;s countenance in the sanctuary should develope
it; until a fire is kindled, <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and he speak with his tongue, making
melody unto the Lord in his heart, and praising Him with his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; It is in vain to urge objections against these
powerful gales of divine influence, and allege that it is under
the ministry of the illiterate preachers of Wales only they are
experienced.&nbsp; Harris, Rowlands, and the two Williamses were
not so, for they had been brought up for the established
church.&nbsp; Whitefield and Edwards were men of education, and
they preached the doctrine which in England is considered
evangelical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6.&nbsp; It is also beside the point to affirm that
only persons of no weight, that is, ignorant boys and girls, are
in the habit of thus rejoicing and praising God in His temple;
for it is certain, that those who express their joy in this
manner possess so much sound experimental knowledge, as to make
them eminent in that respect.&nbsp; I have listened to many of
them in the midst of their enjoyment, and have often been
delighted while they repeated true, evangelical, and substantial
stanzas, replete with profound sentiment: for in such seasons,
they could find out the very best, which made impressions on
their memories; and these rapturous feelings developed them, as
if the tongue were moved by the heat and force of the fire
within.&nbsp; And many other things of an evangelical and
gracious character they will utter on these joyful occasions,
with such heavenly eloquence as would be inimitable, and
impracticable even for themselves to utter with the same effect,
without enjoying these meltings of spirit.&nbsp; This enjoyment
is accompanied by many tears and much tenderness of heart: nor
are persons of a dry spirit and hard heart ever regarded as fit
subjects for this work of praise, in these blessed seasons of
Christian enjoyment.&nbsp; It does not accord with any, but with
him whose heart melts like wax, and runs in the form and mould of
the gospel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;7.&nbsp; There is no way in which churches or
particular persons may enjoy this heavenly ecstasy, but by
walking with God, and by cultivating a spirit of watchfulness and
prayer, which shows its pure and holy character.&nbsp; It awakens
watchfulness against all evil tempers, improper expressions, and
wicked actions, lest the sense of it should be lost.&nbsp; Such a
frame of mind cannot be expected by living in sin.&nbsp; These
individuals come to the house of God with an earnest desire for
this enjoyment, and dreading lest there should be a something in
them which would cause God to deny them <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>this
unspeakable privilege.&nbsp; It is an exceedingly easy matter for
a minister to manage a congregation while Christian enjoyment
keeps them near to God.&nbsp; They are diligent and zealous, and
ready for every good work.&nbsp; But it is very easy to offend
this joyous spirit&mdash;or give it what name you please,
enthusiasm, religious madness, or Welsh jumping, (its English
name,)&mdash;and make it hide itself.&nbsp; A quarrel and
disagreement in the church will occasion it to withdraw
immediately.&nbsp; Indulging in sin, in word or deed, will soon
put it to flight.&nbsp; It is like unto the angel formerly, who
could not behold the sin of Israel without hiding himself; so is
the angel of the <i>religious</i> life of Wales, which proves him
to be a holy angel, though he has the name of a &lsquo;Welsh
jumper.&rsquo;&nbsp; My prayer is, that this angel be a guard
upon every congregation, and that none should do any thing to
offend him.&nbsp; It is an exceedingly powerful assistant to
accompany us through the wilderness.&nbsp; But the individual
that has not felt its happy influences, has nothing to lose;
hence he does not dread a dry meeting and a hard prayer, for they
are all the same to him; but the people of this enjoyment pray
before prayer, and before hearing, that they may meet with God in
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;8.&nbsp; The seasons when these blessings are
vouchsafed to the churches of Wales, are to be noticed.&nbsp; It
is generally at a time when the cause of religion is at a low
ebb&mdash;all gone to slumber.&nbsp; This happy spirit of
enjoyment, like the angel of the pillar of fire, appears when
there is distress, and every thing at the worst.&nbsp; Its
approach to the congregation is like the glory of God returning
to the temple of old; it creates a stir among the
brethren,&mdash;they have a new prayer, and a new spirit given
them to worship God.&nbsp; This will lay hold of
another,&mdash;some new strength and light will appear in the
pulpit, until it will be imagined that the preacher&rsquo;s voice
is altered, and that his spirit is become more evangelical, and
that he preaches with a more excellent savor than usual.&nbsp;
Tenderness will descend upon the members, and it will be seen
that Mr. Wet-eyes and Mr. Amen have taken their place among
them.&nbsp; The heavenly gale will reach some of the old
backsliders, and they are brought with weeping to seek their
forfeited privilege.&nbsp; By this time the sound of Almighty God
will be heard in the outer court, beginning to move the hearers
like a mighty wind shaking the forest.&nbsp; In these seasons of
refreshing from the presence of the Lord some churches <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>will receive,
in the course of a year, additions of one hundred, others a
hundred and fifty, and some others upwards of two hundred new
members.&nbsp; Sometimes, the gale seems as if it blew upon the
outer court&mdash;upon the hearers, and the young people from ten
to fifteen years of age&mdash;when nothing extraordinary appears
in the light and effect of the ministry, nor in the church; but
afterwards making its way through the outer court to rouse the
inner court, until a great concern is awakened for the state of
the soul.&nbsp; But observe: The revival that begins in the
church, and proceeds from thence to the world, and not that which
commences outside of the church, is more frequent, and more
efficient in its converts, for the pangs of labor are to begin in
Zion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;9.&nbsp; Again, it may be remarked that the happy
effects which follow these powerful revivals, evince their
nature.&nbsp; They are certain, where they are strong, to bend
the oaks of Bashan&mdash;men of strong and sturdy minds, and
haughty hearts&mdash;to attend the ministry of the word.&nbsp;
They will bring all the ships of Tarshish, the merchants of this
world, into the harbor of hearing.&nbsp; The power of the day of
the Lord will raze all the walls of bigotry to the
foundations.&nbsp; The thoughts of eternal realities, and the
spirit of worship, are by these blessings diffused abroad, and
family worship is established in scores of families, where a few
months before no regard was had unto it.&nbsp; The door of such a
district, thus opened by the powers of the world to come, shall
not be closed against the hearers of the gospel, until a goodly
number of souls are there converted unto God.&nbsp; Where the
living waters flow, dead fish are made alive by its virtues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;10.&nbsp; Since the first appearing of these gracious
gifts at Llangeitho, under the ministry of Mr. Rowlands, they
have been showers of blessings, which are poured down on the
congregations of the Baptists and Congregationalists as well as
the Calvinistic Methodists; and sometimes one of these
denominations is favored with them, whilst the others are
destitute.&nbsp; These refreshing seasons were, at times,
experienced in a very powerful manner at Llangeitho, for about
fifty years; that is, all the period of Mr. Rowlands&rsquo;
ministrations in that church.&nbsp; About two thousand persons
assembled there for communion once a month, from the several
counties of Wales, even in winter, and about three thousand in
the summer season; which rendered it the most extraordinary place
in <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Europe,
and beyond a doubt, hundreds of those who assembled there, on
such occasions, are now in heaven singing the new song.&nbsp; If
to live on the merits of Christ, to fear God, and praise him, and
lead a sober and righteous life, is an evidence of a godly state,
then this was visible <i>at that time</i> at
Llangeitho.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CAERNARVON.</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans&rsquo; next settlement was in Caernarvon.&nbsp; The
Baptist interest in that town was in a feeble and languishing
condition.&nbsp; The church numbered about thirty members, but
they were chiefly of the lowest class, and sadly disunited.&nbsp;
They had a decent house of worship, but it was involved in a debt
of &pound;800.&nbsp; &ldquo;All things,&rdquo; said Mr. Evans,
&ldquo;seemed like a waste howling wilderness; yea, a habitation
of dragons, where they made their rest night and
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some advised the dissolution of the church, but
he thought better to attempt its reformation.&nbsp; His coming
produced quite a sensation through the town.&nbsp; His first
congregation was very large, and for some time multitudes flocked
to his ministry, but they were only accidental hearers, generally
members of other churches, who, when they had satisfied their
curiosity, returned to their own places of worship.&nbsp; His
Welsh biographer mentions with commendation the sympathy and help
which he received from the Wesleyan and the Calvinistic
Methodists, and Mr. Evans himself calls them the Aarons and the
Hurs that sustained his hands in Caernarvon.</p>
<p>His labors and zeal in this place were not less than in
Caerphilly and Cardiff; but owing to many unfavorable
circumstances, his success was far inferior.&nbsp; During the
first year, however, he reduced the chaos around him to some
incipient order; and was enabled, by the payment of a mortgage
upon the church, to save it from sheriff&rsquo;s sale.&nbsp; He
employed a Mr. Edwards to travel into England, Ireland, and
Scotland, and make collections for this purpose.&nbsp; Mr. Evans
was already known extensively, as the author of the celebrated
Specimen of Welsh Preaching, which had been translated into
English, and published in many of the periodicals, eliciting
universal admiration.&nbsp; Mr. Edwards had this piece reprinted,
and distributed the copies wherever he went, thus making known
the pastor of the church for which he solicited pecuniary
aid.</p>
<p>Though the aged servant of God saw few conversions from his <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>labors in
Caernarvon, the seed which he sowed in tears upon that sterile
soil has sprung up since his decease, and others have gathered
the harvest.&nbsp; The Baptist church there has experienced a
gracious revival, and many of the new converts attribute their
salvation, under God, to Christmas Evans.</p>
<p>While in Caernarvon he penned in his journal the following
pious reflections: &ldquo;I have been thinking of the great
goodness of the Lord unto me throughout my unworthy ministry, and
now, in my old age, I see the work prospering wonderfully in my
hand, so that there is reason to think that I am in some degree a
blessing to the church, when I might have been a burden to it, or
rather a curse, by which she might have been induced to wish me
laid in the earth, that I might no longer prevent the progress of
the work.&nbsp; Thanks be to God, that it is not so! though I
deserve no better; yet I am in the land of mercy.&nbsp; This is
unto me according to the manner of God unto his people.&nbsp; My
path in the valley, the dangers, and the precipices of
destruction upon which I have stood, rushes into my thoughts, and
also the sinking of many in death, and the downfall of others by
immorality, and their burial in Kibroth-Hattaavah, the graves of
inordinate desire; together with the withering, the feebleness,
and the unfruitfulness of some through the influence of a secret
departure from God, and of walking in the hidden paths that lead
to apostasy.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>PULPIT POPULARITY.</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans&rsquo; popularity in the pulpit was never greater
than during the last few years of his life.&nbsp; His descriptive
powers, which were transcendent from the first, improved to the
day of his death.&nbsp; His services were always solicited at the
anniversaries of the Missionary and Bible societies in
Caernarvon, and the mayor of that town once made him a handsome
present for a temperance speech which he delivered there.</p>
<p>In 1834, he preached at the Holyhead association.&nbsp; His
text was Heb. vi. 18.&nbsp; There were many seamen present; and
beautifully did the preacher describe the believer&rsquo;s hope,
&ldquo;the anchor of the soul;&rdquo; and eloquently did he set
forth the necessity of its having, not a bare rock, but a rock
covered with clay&mdash;not abstract divinity, but &ldquo;God
manifest in the flesh,&rdquo;&mdash;in order that its hold may <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>be
&ldquo;sure and steadfast,&rdquo; securing the Christian against
spiritual shipwreck amid the many storms of the World!</p>
<p>The last association he ever attended in Anglesea was held in
the same place, in 1837.&nbsp; On that occasion he preached from
Col. ii. 14, 15.&nbsp; This sermon was one of the most effective
he ever delivered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The powerful manner,&rdquo; says
one of his friends &ldquo;in which he described the enemies, who
were like unicorns and strong bulls of Bashan, and all the little
elves&mdash;the great roaring lion, together with all the hosts
and principalities and powers of hell, death, and the grave,
giving way when Christ cried, &lsquo;It is finished,&rsquo; was
indescribably grand and majestic: one might have thought that the
scene was actually before the eye, and that Jesus could be then
seen laying hold of the powers of darkness, casting them forth,
and making a show of them openly.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>INTERESTING LETTER.</h3>
<p>We insert in this place an interesting letter written during
Mr. Evans&rsquo; residence at Caernarvon.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beloved Brother: * * * I write to you,
August 5, 1836, in the seventieth year of my age, and in the
fiftieth of my ministry, after conversing much with ministerial
brethren, earnestly desiring to see our associational union
brought into action by representatives of the churches, with a
view to promote a determination,&mdash;1.&nbsp; To bear each
other&rsquo;s burden more efficiently in the denomination to
which we belong.&nbsp; I lament the deficiency in this point, and
ardently wish to see it effectually remedied.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; To
watch over and promote a holy conversation among all the members
and all the preachers in a more efficient manner, to prevent
persons of unbecoming conversation from obtaining privileges in
any church, when they have been excluded in another, for that
would occasion spots and blemishes to appear on the bright
countenance of the ministry.&nbsp; The associational union, in
which all the churches of the same faith and order join, should
be a defence of the independence of the churches through their
representatives: it should also operate as a sort of check upon
independency, lest it should become opposed to the general good,
and frustrate the co-operation of the whole body.&nbsp; <i>That
they may all be one</i>, is the motto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respecting church discipline.&nbsp; We cannot be
certain that we <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>are doing right by administering the same punishment to
all offenders, even for the same offence; for the general
character weighs heavily in the balance of discipline.&nbsp; Also
a distinction should be made between the seducer and the seduced;
and between being overcome, or falling into sin, and living
habitually in sin, and following it as a slave following his
master.&nbsp; The denial of Peter, from weakness, and without
previous deliberation, was very different from the betrayal of
Judas, and his intentional selling of Christ.&nbsp; The different
characters of Saul, king of Israel, and that of David, required
different treatment in discipline on account of their
offences.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s discipline upon Saul was that of
a rod of iron, but upon David the correcting rod of a father, for
his good, that he might be a partaker of his holiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two things, brother, which we ought to avoid
in the exercise of discipline.&nbsp; 1. We should avoid too great
severity on the one part, and 2, too much leniency on the other
part.&nbsp; Wisdom is necessary here to distinguish the different
characters, those who require severity, and those who claim
tenderness: the two are to be found blended in the principle of
evangelical discipline.&nbsp; A difference is to be made betwixt
some who may have been companions in the same crime; snatching
some of them as brands from the burning.&nbsp; The ground of the
distinction lies in the different amount of guilt which subsists
between the seducer and the seduced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have witnessed danger, and have sustained some harm
myself, and seen harm done in churches, by exercising tenderness
towards some persons, in the vain hope of their
reformation.&nbsp; Receiving verbal testimony or mere fluent
acknowledgments from their lips, without waiting for fruit in
action also: some having been often accused, and as often turning
to the refuges frequented by them.&nbsp; I never exercised
tenderness towards such as these, without being repaid by them
afterwards, if they had opportunity.&nbsp; Shimei-like, they
would curse me after having shed the best oil of tenderness on
their heads.&nbsp; There are some in the Christian church like
Jezebel; and there are some in our congregations like Joab, the
son of Zeruiah, that you can scarce discipline them without
rending the kingdom, until they become ripe for judgment; for
they hardly ever repent, more than did Joab and Shimei; they are
ultimately suddenly broken, without any danger to the church from
their fall.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&ldquo;I perceive that the Scriptures make a difference
between one that falls into sin, and one wallowing in it; between
one overtaken by a party of marauders, and dragged into the camp,
and made drunk at supper, and one like Judas, going to the party,
and being secretly one of them, having pistols as they had: such
are hypocrites.&nbsp; I have many times been the advocate of the
fallen, and in a variety of instances have observed this
operating beneficially for the church.&nbsp; Sometimes I have
found those who had been spared upon their own verbal contrition,
blessing God for his long forbearance of them, and also their
spiritual brethren, who had in a manner set their bones; as the
Scripture hath it, &lsquo;Restore such an one in the spirit of
meekness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be careful that discretion and love be in
exercise, though in strife and contention it be not always an
easy matter to do this.&nbsp; When the beasts of dissension get
loose from the caravan, Satan sometimes drives them through the
streets of Zion, that they may enter the houses of the
inhabitants; and like the lioness that escaped from the keepers
at Shrewsbury, and attacked the foremost horse in the carriage;
<a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> so contentions frequently attack the
leaders, in order to stop the carriage of the ministry as it
travels on in the labors of the pulpit.&nbsp; In the midst of the
noise of strife, the man of God must raise his voice to heaven
for courage and tenderness, so that the oil of Christ&rsquo;s
love to the souls of men may be found in the oil-flagon of
reproof, which is poured on the head; for if anger and revenge
enter in, they will drop, like the spider in Germany, into the
pot, and that will prevent the salutary effect of the oil,
because the poison of wrath is mixed with it.&nbsp; The
righteousness of God cannot be fulfilled in this manner in the
discipline.&nbsp; O! brother, who is sufficient for these things,
without constant help from heaven?&nbsp; How awful is this
place!&nbsp; This is the house of God and the gate of
heaven&mdash;and here is a ladder by which we may climb up for
help; and a school in which we may learn how to conduct ourselves
in the house of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot but be conscious, brother, of the great
difficulty there is not to speak unadvisedly with our lips, as
did Moses whilst drawing water for the rebellious
Israelites.&nbsp; The rebellion of the <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>people had imbittered his spirit, so
that his obduracy stood like a cloud between the people and the
tenderness of the Lord, when he was showing mercy upon them by
giving them water.&nbsp; Moses upbraided their rebellion instead
of showing mercy, as the dispensation of God now required; a
dispensation which contained in it a secret intimation of the
great mercy to be shown by the death of Christ on the
cross.&nbsp; Their strife was the cause of imbittering the spirit
of Moses, yet he should have possessed his soul in patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two things, brother, which you should
observe: First, you will be called upon to attend to causes of
contention; and you will find persons so hardened, that you will
not be able to obtain weapons in all the armory of God&rsquo;s
word that will terrify them and make them afraid of entering
their old haunts.&nbsp; Such are persons without faith, and
without the fear of God and the love of Christ influencing their
minds; and though you warn them of the consequences of their
contentions, that they are likely to deprive them of the
privileges of the house of God, and thus forfeit the promised
land, yet they stand unmoved, nothing terrified, for they value
the flesh-pots of Egypt and their livelihood there, more than the
manna and the land of promise.&nbsp; You cannot frighten them by
speaking of the danger and loss of the immunities of the church
below, or that above; Esau-like, they will sell their birthright
as Christian professors for a mess of pottage.&nbsp; A man who
has no money is not afraid to meet with robbers in the wood; but
the individual that has gold to lose will be cautious and
watchful, lest he should be robbed of his property.&nbsp; On a
night of great storm, when ships are broken to pieces and
sinking, a person who has no share in any of them will not
tremble or feel any concern on their account.&nbsp; Thus there
are some men concerning whom it is impossible to make them dread
going out among the rapacious beasts of backslidings, and no
storms can keep them in fear.&nbsp; Their spirit is one with the
marauders, and they have no care, for they have nothing to lose
in the tempests that blow upon the cause of the religion of
Christ.&nbsp; These are the tares, or the children of the wicked
one, in the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secondly, for your own encouragement, brother, I remark
that you will have to attend to the exercise of discipline, and
to treat with persons that may be alarmed, and made to tremble at
the word of God, and not rush on presumptuously in their evil
course.&nbsp; These are professors who possess white garments,
and the gold of <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>faith, and eye-salve from the unction of the Holy
One.&nbsp; These individuals are rich in faith.&nbsp; They are
afraid of revolutions and upsettings of the constitutional order
of the new covenant, for they have funds invested in the stocks
of God&rsquo;s kingdom.&nbsp; They are afraid that any storm or
rock of offence should come in the way of the gospel ship, for
their treasure is on board of it, and they have an interest in
it.&nbsp; They dread the thought of walking unwatchfully and
licentiously, lest they should be robbed of their riches, and
forfeit the fellowship of God in prayer, lose the light of his
countenance, and his peace in the means of grace, and lest they
should be deprived of their confidence in the merits of Christ
and a good conscience.&nbsp; They have denied themselves, and
have pulled out the right eye, lest they should not be acceptable
before God.&nbsp; They dread harboring in their bosoms the old
guilt and former doubts.&nbsp; They are cautious not to give a
night&rsquo;s lodging to such miscreants as anger, revenge, lust,
and things which are of the earth; for they know that these are
robbers, and if they have any indulgence they will steal away the
<i>title-deeds</i> of assurance to the inheritance.&nbsp; They
are well aware, also, that they will sustain the loss of a pure
conscience, which has been purged by the blood of Christ, and
which, as a golden chest, is a preserver of our confidence
immovable unto the end.&nbsp; It is possible, brother, to manage
and discipline such professors.&nbsp; They have something to
lose, consequently they will not flee from their refuge, lest
they should be destroyed.&nbsp; <i>Keep that which thou
hast</i>.&nbsp; David lost for a season the enjoyment of the
above blessings; but he was cleansed with hyssop, had his spirit
renewed, and his riches were restored to him by faith&rsquo;s
view of the Messiah, for which he vowed to sing aloud for ever
and ever.&nbsp; He prayed, after this, to be delivered from
presumptuous sins, lest he should be imprisoned a second time by
a party so wicked and detestable.&nbsp; May the spiritual gift be
kindled in you, brother.&nbsp; Grace be with you for ever and
ever.</p>

<h2><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>TOUR
THROUGH THE PRINCIPALITY.</h2>
<p>In April, 1838, when Mr. Evans had been about four years in
Caernarvon, the church under his charge received notice to pay up
the &pound;300 yet due on their house of worship.&nbsp; He took a
tour through the principality, to collect money for this
purpose.&nbsp; Before he set out, he wrote a circular to his
brethren, which was published in the Welsh Magazine.&nbsp; We
make the following extract:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The term of the lease of life has expired
in my case, even three score and ten years, and I am very much
afflicted.&nbsp; I have purposed to sacrifice myself to this
object, though I am afraid I shall die in the journey, and fear I
shall not succeed in my errand for Christ.&nbsp; We have no
source to which we can now repair, but our own denomination in
Wales, and brethren and friends of other communities that may
sympathize with us.&nbsp; O brethren, pray with me for protection
on the journey&mdash;for strength and health this <i>once</i>, on
occasion of my bidding farewell to you all&mdash;pray for the
light of the Lord&rsquo;s countenance upon me in preaching, pray
for his own glory, and that his key may open the hearts of the
people to contribute towards his cause in its present
exigency.&nbsp; O help us, brethren,&mdash;when you see the old
brother, after having been fifty-three years in the ministry,
now, instead of being in the grave with his colleagues, or
resting at home with three of them who are yet
alive&mdash;brethren Lewis of Llanwenarth, Davies of Velin Voel,
and Thomas of Aberduar <a name="citation56"></a><a
href="#footnote56" class="citation">[56]</a>&mdash;when you see
him coming, with the furrows of death in his countenance, the
flowers of the grave on his head, and his whole constitution
gradually dissolving; having labored fifty years in the ministry
in the Baptist denomination.&nbsp; He comes to you with hundreds
of prayers bubbling as it were from the fountain of his heart,
and with a mixture of fear and confidence.&nbsp; O do not frown
upon him!&mdash;he is afraid of your frowns.&nbsp; Smile upon him
by contributing cheerfully to his cause this once for all.&nbsp;
If you frown upon me, ministers and deacons, by intimating an
<i>irregular case</i>, I am afraid I shall sink into the grave
before returning home.&nbsp; This is my last sacrifice for the
Redeemer&rsquo;s cause.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>In this
journey, he was cordially received everywhere by the churches,
and very successful in raising money.&nbsp; At no former period
of his life was his popularity so great as now.&nbsp; Wherever he
preached, the place was thronged at an early hour; and frequently
multitudes remained without, unable to obtain admittance.</p>
<h3>MONMOUTHSHIRE ASSOCIATION.</h3>
<p>During this tour, he attended the Monmouthshire Association,
and preached his last associational sermon.&nbsp; In his
introduction, he described a man whom he had seen in Caernarvon,
throwing a few beans to a herd of swine that followed him, and
thus enticing them to the door of the slaughter-house, where they
were to be slain; and said that, in a similar manner, with one
temptation after another, Satan allures deluded sinners to the
very gates of hell, where they are to be tormented for ever and
ever.&nbsp; He spoke of the gospel on the day of Pentecost, as a
great electrical machine; Christ turning the handle; Peter
placing the chain in contact with the people: and the Holy Ghost
descending like a stream of ethereal fire, and melting the hearts
of three thousand at once!</p>
<p>Perhaps no sermon that Mr. Evans ever preached evinced more
vigor of intellect, more power and splendor of genius, than this;
and seldom, if ever, had he a more perfect command over the
feelings of an audience.&nbsp; But the effort was too much for
him, and he was afterward confined to his room by illness for a
week.</p>
<h3>LAST SERMON, SICKNESS, AND DEATH.</h3>
<p>Following this indefatigable man of God, we find him, on
Sunday, the fifteenth of July, notwithstanding his late illness,
at Swansea, preaching like a seraph, on the Prodigal Son in the
morning, and in the evening on the words of St.
Paul&mdash;&ldquo;I am not ashamed of the gospel of
Christ,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>The next evening he preached in the church at Mount
Pleasant.&nbsp; He said he had taken his pulpit model from the
day of Pentecost.&nbsp; He described the event of that memorable
day, as a great naval battle between Emanuel and the Prince of
Darkness.&nbsp; &ldquo;The captain of our salvation&rdquo; sent
out twelve little boats to engage the whole fleet of hell.&nbsp;
For a time all was enveloped in fire and smoke, and the issue of
the day seemed doubtful; but when the conflict <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>ceased, and
the cloud cleared away, it was ascertained that the twelve little
boats had captured three thousand of Satan&rsquo;s ships of
war.</p>
<p>When the preacher sat down, he said, &ldquo;<i>This is my last
sermon</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it was.&nbsp; That night he was
taken violently ill.&nbsp; The next day he lay in a partial
stupor, taking but little notice of his friends.&nbsp; The third
day he seemed somewhat better.&nbsp; On the morning of the fourth
day, Thursday, he arose and walked in the garden.&nbsp; Toward
evening he sunk again, and grew worse during the night.&nbsp; At
two of the clock on Friday morning, he said to his
friends:&mdash;&ldquo;I am about to leave you.&nbsp; I have
labored in the sanctuary fifty-three years; and this is my
comfort and confidence, that I have never labored without blood
in the basin&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, evidently, that he had not
failed to preach &ldquo;Jesus Christ, and him
crucified.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a few more remarks of a similar
character, he repeated a Welsh stanza, expressive of his firm
trust in the Redeemer; and then, as if he had done with earth,
and desired to depart, exclaimed in English&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Good-bye</span>! <span class="smcap">drive
on</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp; He now turned over, and seemed to
sleep.&nbsp; His friends tried to rouse him.&nbsp; It was too
late.&nbsp; The angelic postillion had obeyed the order.&nbsp;
The chariot had passed over the everlasting hills.</p>
<p>Thus died Christmas Evans, at the house of his friend, Rev.
Daniel Davies, in Swansea, July 19th, 1838, in the 73d year of
his age, and the 54th of his ministry.&nbsp; His life was
blameless, and his end was peace.&nbsp; &ldquo;This honor have
all his saints!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>FUNEREAL SORROW.</h3>
<p>His funeral took place four days after his death.&nbsp; Never
before was there such a funeral in Swansea, never such a
concourse of mourners.&nbsp; The people came in crowds, and wept
their way to the grave as if they had been following the bier of
their father.&nbsp; The melancholy tidings of his departure
spread through the principality, and the fountains of sorrow were
everywhere unsealed.&nbsp; In Anglesea, especially, the grief was
deep and universal.&nbsp; There he had spent more than half of
his ministerial life, and hundreds owned him as their father in
Christ.&nbsp; The Baptist pulpits were all clothed in mourning,
and funeral sermons were preached throughout the
principality.</p>
<h2><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>PORTRAITURE.</h2>
<h3>PERSONAL APPEARANCE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Evans</span> was a good-looking man,
nearly six feet high, and well proportioned.&nbsp; His
intellectual faculties, phrenologically speaking, were amply
developed.&nbsp; He had lost one of his eyes in his youth, but
the other was large and bright enough for two.&nbsp; It had a
peculiarly penetrating glance; and when kindling under the
inspiration of the pulpit, added wonderfully to the effect of his
eloquence.&nbsp; All his features were expressive of intelligence
and love; his whole bearing, dignified and majestic; and the
blending of great and amiable qualities in his character
commanded at once the reverence and the confidence of all who
knew him.</p>
<h3>MORAL AND CHRISTIAN CHARACTER.</h3>
<p>From the time of his conversion to the day of his death, Mr.
Evans exhibited a consistent and exemplary piety.&nbsp; Though he
several times fell into darkness and doubt, and lost a portion of
his burning zeal, he never forfeited his place in the church, or
tarnished his Christian name.&nbsp; The uprightness of his
deportment was acknowledged by all his neighbors; and those of
other denominations, differing widely from him in creed and
custom, always accorded to him the reputation of &ldquo;a holy
man of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his piety was never ostentatious or
austere.&nbsp; Modesty and humility were among his most prominent
qualities, and a high degree of Christian cheerfulness
characterized his conversation.&nbsp; However low, at times, his
religious enjoyment, he was always careful to walk with becoming
circumspection before the world, that the cause of Christ might
suffer no reproach through his imprudence.</p>
<h3><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>SOCIAL
DISPOSITION.</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans was naturally of a quick and irritable temper; but
Divine Grace subdued his constitutional impetuosity, made him
&ldquo;gentle toward all men,&rdquo; and clothed him with
&ldquo;the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was eminently social in his feelings, and took great delight in
the company of his friends.&nbsp; It cost him no effort to render
himself agreeable in any society.&nbsp; In the cottage and the
mansion he was equally at home, and the unlettered peasant and
the erudite philosopher were equally interested by his
conversation.&nbsp; He never had any children of his own, but was
always remarkably fond of the children of others.&nbsp; After
discoursing for an hour on the sublimest topics of the Christian
faith, in a style befitting their importance, to the great
delight, and often to the amazement of all who heard him, he
would descend to the relation of some pretty story, in a manner
so affectionate and familiar as at once to win the hearts and
enlighten the minds of half a dozen bright-eyed little creatures,
grouped around him like Peter Parley&rsquo;s scholars in the
picture.</p>
<h3>READING AND STUDY.</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans was a great lover of books.&nbsp; He seized and
devoured with avidity every interesting volume that fell in his
way.&nbsp; He never resorted to reading, however, as a mere
pastime.&nbsp; He sought for mental and spiritual treasures to
enrich his sermons.&nbsp; For this he beat the fields and dug the
wells of knowledge.&nbsp; Every thing was made subservient to his
holy calling.&nbsp; Every thing was pressed into his preparations
for the pulpit.&nbsp; His authors were selected with prudent
discrimination, and perused with earnest attention, indicating an
intense desire to be thoroughly furnished for his work.&nbsp; He
studied what he read.&nbsp; He was extensively acquainted with
the best theological writers of the age, and quoted them
frequently in his discourses.&nbsp; But there is one volume to
which he referred more frequently than to all the rest,
&ldquo;the book of books divine.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was emphatically
&ldquo;a man mighty in the Scriptures.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the word
of God he derived the principal matter of his preaching.&nbsp; <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Even that
lofty imagery which constituted the peculiar charm of his
ministry, was ordinarily but an amplification of scriptural
tropes and descriptions.&nbsp; In theology, next to the Bible,
Dr. Owen was his favorite author.&nbsp; He paid considerable
attention to Oriental manners and customs; was well read in
history, ancient and modern; and particularly fond of tracing the
rise and fall of empires.</p>
<h3>DEVOTIONAL HABITS.</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans was eminently a man of prayer.&nbsp; Prayer was his
daily bread, the very breath of his spirit.&nbsp; He considered
himself entitled, through Christ, to all the blessings of the
gospel, and came boldly to the throne of grace in every time of
need.&nbsp; During his whole ministerial life, much of his time
was spent in the closet.&nbsp; It was his custom for many years,
to retire for devotion three times during the day, and rise
regularly for the same purpose at midnight.&nbsp; The disorders
of the church, the slanders of his enemies, and the various
afflictions of life, all drove him to the mercy-seat, and made
him peculiarly earnest and importunate in supplication.&nbsp;
After these seasons of agony, he came into the church, or the
social circle, as an angel from the presence of God, and
&ldquo;all his garments smelt of myrrh and aloes and cassia from
the ivory palaces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never undertook a new enterprise, without first asking
counsel of the Lord.&nbsp; When he had a call to another field of
labor, he could not decide upon the matter till he had spread it
repeatedly before the throne.&nbsp; When he was about to preach
at an association, or on any important occasion, he wrestled for
hours with the angel of the covenant, nor relinquished his hold
till he felt himself &ldquo;endued with power from on
high.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he came forth to the congregation, as
Moses from the Tabernacle, when he had communed with God.&nbsp;
Just before leaving home on his tour of collection for the
Caernarvon church, the last labor of his life, he penned in his
book of appointments the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O Lord, grant me my desire on this journey,
for thy name&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; My first petition;&mdash;Comfort
in Christ&mdash;the comfort of love&mdash;the bowels of love and
mercy in the denomination&mdash;the fellowship of the
Spirit.&mdash;Amen.&nbsp; My second petition;&mdash;That the
sermons I have prepared for this journey may increase in their
ministration, like the five loaves and two
fishes.&mdash;Amen.&nbsp; C. E.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>CHRISTIAN BENEFICENCE.</h3>
<p>Mr. Evans was a poor man, but &ldquo;rich in good
works.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suffering poverty always excited his pity,
and opened his purse.&nbsp; Wherever he beheld distress, he was
&ldquo;ready to distribute, willing to communicate,&rdquo;
according to the ability which God had given him.&nbsp; His
salary in Anglesea, for twenty years, was only seventeen pounds
per annum; and afterward, only thirty.&nbsp; With so small an
income, he could not be expected to bestow much upon the various
objects of charity.&nbsp; But he gave annually one pound to the
Bible Society, one pound to the Missionary Society, and ten
shillings to the Baptist Education Society, besides contributing
liberally to the relief of the poor and the sick in his
neighborhood.</p>
<p>Sometimes his liberality was larger than his purse.&nbsp;
Once, when a Protestant Irishman, poorly clad, told him that he
spent much time in reading the Scriptures to his illiterate
countrymen, he pulled off his own coat, and gave it to him.&nbsp;
At another time, he presented a poor Jew, who had recently been
converted to Christianity, a new suit of clothes, the best he had
in his wardrobe.&nbsp; While in Anglesea, he visited a brother in
the church, who had been reduced by protracted illness to a
condition of great distress; and finding the family almost in a
state of starvation, emptied his pocket of the only pound he
had.&nbsp; His wife remonstrated with him, told him she had not
bread enough in the house to last twenty-four hours, and demanded
what he would do now he had given away all his money.&nbsp; His
only answer was: &ldquo;Jehovah-jireh; the Lord will
provide!&rdquo;&nbsp; The next day he received a letter from
England, enclosing two pounds as a present.&nbsp; As soon as he
had read it, he called out to his
wife;&mdash;&ldquo;Catherine!&nbsp; I told thee that Providence
would return the alms-pound, for it was a loan to the Lord; and
see, here it is, doubled in one day!&rdquo;&nbsp; It is evident
from this incident, that Mr. Evans&rsquo; liberality was the
fruit of his faith in God; and the good man&rsquo;s confidence is
never put to shame.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is that scattereth, and
yet increaseth.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>SPIRIT
OF FORGIVENESS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Be ye merciful, even as your Father who is in heaven is
merciful.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no virtue more beautiful in its
character, or more important to the Christian, than that thus
enjoined by the Son of God.&nbsp; The spirit of forgiveness
infinitely transcends all the effects of mere human philosophy,
and allies man to his Maker.&nbsp; In this amiable quality,
Christmas Evans was never wanting.&nbsp; He took a thousand times
more pleasure in pardoning the offender, than the offender in
asking his pardon.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was only,&rdquo; says his
Welsh biographer, &ldquo;for the person who had given offence to
make some sort of acknowledgment, to say there had been a
misunderstanding.&nbsp; Mr. Evans would anticipate him
with:&mdash;&lsquo;O, say nothing about it! let it be buried!
very likely I have been in fault myself!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The
spirit of Mr. Evans&rsquo; diary everywhere corroborates this
description of his character.&nbsp; We extract a single
paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I trust that by the grace of God, I have
overcome my natural disposition to anger and revenge.&nbsp; I
have been enabled to forgive my greatest enemies, and pray that
they may be forgiven of God.&nbsp; I can say from my heart, with
Stephen; &lsquo;Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge!&rsquo;&nbsp; I have no wish that any of them should
suffer for their attempts to injure me, but that they may all be
led to repentance, and settle their matters at the mercy-seat,
where I hope also that the multitude of my own trespasses will be
covered and forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His mercy was as impartial as it was cordial.&nbsp; He had
held a controversy with a minister of another sect, who,
forgetting the rules of Christian courtesy, treated him very
unkindly before the public.&nbsp; This minister was afterward
arraigned and imprisoned on a very serious allegation.&nbsp; If
he had been convicted, degradation from the ministry would have
been the smallest part of his punishment.&nbsp; Mr. Evans,
learning the fact, and believing the prosecution unjust and
malicious, felt greatly distressed for his polemical
opponent.&nbsp; On the day of trial, he retired to his room, and
poured out his heart to God on his behalf, for a long time, and
with peculiar fervor.&nbsp; Then he waited with great anxiety for
the issue.&nbsp; As he sat at the table, with several friends and
brethren, a minister, who had been at court, entered the room,
and said; &ldquo;Mr. &mdash; is <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>acquitted!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Evans
instantly fell upon his knees, with tears streaming down his
face, and exclaimed:&mdash;&ldquo;Thanks be unto thee, O Lord
Jesus! for delivering one of thy servants from the mouth of the
lions!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then arose, saluted his friend, and joined
in the mutual congratulations of the company.</p>
<h3>CATHOLIC GENEROSITY.</h3>
<p>That Christmas Evans was no bigot, might be inferred from the
above anecdote.&nbsp; But we have other and ampler evidence of
his Christian catholicity.&nbsp; He was a Baptist; and, with the
rest of his brethren, a strenuous advocate for exclusive
immersion.&nbsp; He was a Calvinist, and thought it very
important to vindicate against Arminian views what are sometimes
called &ldquo;the doctrines of grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was
also a Christian, and held all other Christians as
brethren.&nbsp; He did not repudiate the sincerely pious, because
they could not say his &ldquo;Shibboleth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kind,
candid, and ingenuous, he judged of things according to their
real value and importance, and appreciated true talent and virtue
wherever he found them.&nbsp; His creed was not; &ldquo;I am of
Paul;&rdquo; nor, &ldquo;I am of Apollos;&rdquo; nor, &ldquo;I am
of John the Baptist;&rdquo; but, &ldquo;We are all of
Christ!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not blinded by the senseless
prejudice of sect.&nbsp; He was influenced less by the
peculiarities of his denomination than by the love of
Christ.&nbsp; Many of his warmest friends were ministers of other
orders; and of the Methodists and Congregationalists at
Caernarvon, he made honorable mention in his diary.</p>
<p>The most despicable reptile of the moral world is envy, the
spirit that prompted revolt in heaven, and hurled archangels down
to hell.&nbsp; Yet it is often found among Christians; among the
ministers of a religion whose very principle is charity.&nbsp;
Some men, like king Saul, can never bear a rival.&nbsp; If the
thousands of Israel raise the voice and tune the lyre in honor of
some victorious David, the evil spirit comes upon them, and they
launch their javelins at the young anointed, and seek &ldquo;to
smite him even to the wall.&rdquo;&nbsp; From such feelings Mr.
Evans was always free.&nbsp; His large heart was utterly
incapable of anything of the kind.&nbsp; He esteemed others
better than himself, and in honor preferred his brethren.&nbsp;
Wherever he discovered talent and sanctified ambition in a young
preacher, he never exerted an influence to hinder him, but
heartily bade him <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>God speed.&nbsp; He did not deem it necessary to smite
him on the head with a cudgel to keep him in his place.&nbsp; He
was not afraid that others would outshine him in the
pulpit.&nbsp; He would gladly have taken his place at the feet of
any of Christ&rsquo;s ambassadors.&nbsp; He was willing to accord
due praise to merit, not only in the dead, but also in the
living; not only in those of other countries and other
denominations, but also in those of his native principality and
the Baptist church.&nbsp; His immediate contemporaries and
neighbors were often the subjects of his highest encomiums.&nbsp;
His heart was as large as the world!</p>
<h3>INGENUOUSNESS AND HONESTY.</h3>
<p>A late American writer has said of insincerity, that it is the
most detestable of all vices for which men go unhung.&nbsp; Yet
it must be admitted, there is no vice more prevalent, even among
the professed followers of Him, &ldquo;who knew no iniquity,
neither was guile found in his lips.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sentiment,
that it is right to deceive for the good of the church, is not
peculiar to the Papists.&nbsp; Perhaps the enlightened Protestant
can scarcely be found, who would verbally avow such a doctrine;
but it is often practically avowed, even by the messenger of
truth; and ecclesiastical elevation is sometimes attributable
more to dishonesty than to real virtue or talent.</p>
<p>Christmas Evans&rsquo; popularity, however, could boast a
better origin.&nbsp; It was the spontaneous fruit of his graces
and his gifts.&nbsp; He was never indebted to unfair and
underhanded measures for his success.&nbsp; His conduct was
always open and ingenuous.&nbsp; Of deceit and secret design he
was incapable.&nbsp; He never attempted to build up his own
church by proselyting the converts of other churches.&nbsp; In
one instance, when a young man, who had been educated for the
ministry in the established church of England, came to him,
desiring baptism by immersion, instead of eagerly seizing upon so
valuable an acquisition to the Baptists, as some doubtless would
have done, he endeavored to dissuade him from his purpose, and
yielded at length only to his fervent importunity.</p>
<p>He deemed the slightest departure from truth, in any instance,
a crime, and a deep disgrace to the Christian character.&nbsp; He
was innocent and unsuspecting as a child.&nbsp; His frank and
confiding disposition was unquestionably the occasion of most of
his heavy <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>trials.&nbsp; Jealous and malicious men took advantage
of his Christian simplicity, and made one of his sweetest virtues
a poison to his peace.</p>
<p>He once employed a person to sell a horse for him at a
fair.&nbsp; After some time, he went out to see if he was likely
to succeed.&nbsp; There was a man bargaining for the animal, and
the contract was nearly completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your horse, Mr. Evans?&rdquo; said the
purchaser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly it is,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his age, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this man tells me he is only fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is certainly twenty-three, for he has been with me
these twenty years, and he was three years old when I bought
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he safe-footed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very far from that, I assure you, or I would not part
with him, and he has never been put in harness since I have had
him either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please to go into the house, Mr. Evans,&rdquo;
whispered the man whom he had employed to make the sale,
&ldquo;for I shall never dispose of the horse while you are
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frank manner, however, in which Mr. Evans told him all the
truth, induced the dealer to make the purchase at a very handsome
price; while it procured for Mr. Evans a good name, which is
better than gold.</p>
<h3>SARCASTIC REBUKES.</h3>
<p>In conversation he was always careful of the feelings of
others.&nbsp; He would never employ a sarcastic remark, but for
the purpose of merited rebuke.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is better,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;to keep sarcasms pocketed, if we cannot use them
without wounding the feelings of a friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he
was capable, when occasion required, of wielding this weapon with
terrible effect.&nbsp; Take the following instances:&mdash;</p>
<p>Just before his removal from Cardiff to Caernarvon, he was
conversing on the contemplated change in a circle of several
ministers.&nbsp; His labors had been solicited in two or three
other places, and the company were canvassing the comparative
claims of the different churches.&nbsp; A feeble-minded young man
present, who &ldquo;thought more highly of himself than he ought
to think,&rdquo; said:&mdash;&ldquo;It is my <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>opinion,
Father Evans, that you had better go to Caernarvon.&nbsp; It is
not likely your talents would suit either of the other places,
but I think you might do very well at Caernarvon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Evans opened his large eye upon the speaker, and
replied;&mdash;&ldquo;And hast <i>thou</i> peeped?&nbsp; When
didst thou creep from the shell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once, two ministers, of different sects, were disputing in his
presence on what he deemed an unimportant matter of
ecclesiastical discipline.&nbsp; One of them
asked:&mdash;&ldquo;What say you, Mr. Evans?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Evans replied:&mdash;&ldquo;I saw two boys quarrelling over two
snails.&nbsp; One of them insisted that his snail was the better,
because it had horns; while the other as strenuously argued for
the superiority of his, because it had none.&nbsp; The boys were
very angry and vociferous, but the two snails were
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; The disputants burst into a hearty laugh,
and the debate ended.</p>
<p>A shallow atheist was ridiculing the idea of a God, because,
as he alleged, he had no sensible evidence of his being.&nbsp;
Mr. Evans answered:&mdash;&ldquo;My friend, the mole in the
meadow has never seen a king; shall he therefore say there is no
king?&nbsp; O thou atheistic mole! thou hast never travelled out
of thy own narrow field; and if thou hadst, thou hast no eyes to
see with; and wilt thou dare to say there is no God?&nbsp; Dost
thou think all others as blind as thyself?&nbsp; All that thou
canst say is, that thou dost not see God, and dost not wish to
see him.&nbsp; How dost thou know that the being of a God is not
so manifest on the other side of the river of death, that no
doubt is entertained concerning it throughout all the expanse of
eternity?&nbsp; Can the earth-mole say there is no grand Lama in
Thibet?&nbsp; Poor worm! thou must travel through the gates of
death, and fathom the bottomless pit, and measure the land of
destruction, and scale the very heaven of heavens, and surround
all the borders of time and eternity, before thou canst assure
thyself there is no God!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>PULPIT TALENTS AND LABORS.</h3>
<p>As a preacher, Mr. Evans was very peculiar.&nbsp; No
translation of his sermons can give the English reader an
adequate idea of their force and beauty in the original.</p>
<p>He was exceedingly methodical and perspicuous.&nbsp; His
arrangement was never loose and vague; his thoughts never
confused and <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>mingled together.&nbsp; He was a &ldquo;wise
master-builder,&rdquo; who took care to lay a broad and firm
foundation, and then &ldquo;built thereon gold, silver, and
precious stones.&rdquo;&nbsp; The several parts of his discourse
bore a mutual relation of dependence, and each would have been
incomplete without the others.&nbsp; His order was so natural,
that it was very easy to follow him; and his manner so
impressive, that it was nearly impossible to forget him.</p>
<p>He never spoke on a subject that he did not understand.&nbsp;
Before entering the pulpit, he invariably measured his text in
all its extent, and considered it in every possible aspect.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He had a wonderful method,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;of
making the most abstruse passages appear easy and plain.&nbsp; He
interpreted scripture by scripture, and exhibited the component
parts of his subject in a clear and beautiful manner, and
illustrated them by the most appropriate and striking metaphors;
and forging link by link, united them together, and bound the
whole up in one glorious chain.&nbsp; His talents were such as to
enable him to cast a ray of light upon the darkest points of the
Christian system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Evans&rsquo; descriptive powers were altogether
unique.&nbsp; He abounded in allegories of the most forcible
character.&nbsp; In this respect, he was equaled by none of his
contemporaries; transcended by none of his predecessors.&nbsp;
Passages of this kind will be so frequently met with in the
following selection from his sermons, that it is not necessary to
point them out to the reader.</p>
<p>His happy art of description is attributable chiefly to a very
remarkable imagination.&nbsp; This is one of the primary
qualities of an orator.&nbsp; When it is lacking, no depth of
learning, no graces of delivery, can compensate for its
lack.&nbsp; True, argument is important.&nbsp; There is no
eloquence without argument.&nbsp; Argument must constitute the
bone and the sinew of every good discourse.&nbsp; But the bone
and the sinew constitute only the skeleton.&nbsp; Imagination
must supply the muscle and the nerve.&nbsp; Imagination must
clothe it with beauty, and inspire it with life; give expression
to the features, animation to the eye, and to the tongue motion
and melody articulate.&nbsp; Argument is the John Baptist of
eloquence, after whom there cometh a mightier, baptizing with
fire!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Logic,&rdquo; says Carlyle, &ldquo;is good, but not the
best.&nbsp; The irrefragable doctor, with his chain of
inductions, his corollaries, dilemmas, and other cunning logical
diagrams and apparatus, will cast you a <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>beautiful
horoscope, and speak you reasonable things; nevertheless, the
stolen jewel which you wanted him to find you is not
forthcoming.&nbsp; Often, by some winged word, winged as the
thunderbolt is, of a Luther, Napoleon, Goethe, shall we see the
difficulty split asunder, and its secret laid bare; while the
irrefragable, with all his logical roots, hews at it, and hovers
round it, and finds it on all sides too hard for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Evans had feeling as well as fancy.&nbsp; This in a
preacher is even more important than the other.&nbsp; Here, we
conceive, lies the principal distinction between the orator and
the poet.&nbsp; Poetry is the language of fancy; eloquence, the
language of feeling.&nbsp; The preacher who operates only on the
judgment and the fancy may instruct and please, and thus prepare
the way for persuasion.&nbsp; Persuasion itself requires a warm
and glowing heart.&nbsp; Eloquence has been defined, &ldquo;the
power of imparting one&rsquo;s feelings to others.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you want me to weep,&rdquo; said Horace, &ldquo;you
must weep yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; The preacher who is himself
unmoved, will toil in vain to move his hearers.&nbsp; His sermon
may be as beautiful as the moon-beams on the snow; but it will be
as powerless and as cold.&nbsp; As saith
Longinus:&mdash;&ldquo;The orator must have a vehement and
enthusiastic passion, a certain madness, or divine phrensy,
breathing into his thoughts, and inspiring his
speech.&rdquo;&nbsp; To use the language of
another:&mdash;&ldquo;Truth must be planted in the hot-bed of
feeling, if we would witness its flowery development, and enjoy
its fruit.&nbsp; The orator must be roused and inflamed by the
majesty of his theme; not wrought up into an unmeaning fury, like
a tempest in a tea-pot; but influenced and agitated by solemn
considerations of truth, duty, interest, and moral
grandeur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this description of eloquence was ever realized in the
pulpit, it was in the preaching of Christmas Evans.&nbsp; He
spoke what he felt, and because he felt.&nbsp; The fountain was
in his own soul, and it flowed out upon his audience in streams
of living water.&nbsp; He was always full of his subject, and his
ordinary manner was exceedingly ardent and pathetic.&nbsp;
Sometimes he seemed quite overwhelmed with the magnitude and
grandeur of his theme, and then he spoke with such impassioned
earnestness as to storm the hearts of his hearers.&nbsp; Thus
inspired, it was scarcely possible that any man of ordinary
sensibilities should be otherwise than eloquent.&nbsp; But Mr.
Evans&rsquo; talents were of a superior order; and when kindling
with the <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>enthusiasm of his message, he became peculiarly
energetic and impressive.&nbsp; &ldquo;His words came out,&rdquo;
as Longinus says, &ldquo;as if discharged from an engine,&rdquo;
and their influence rested like a spell upon the ear and the
heart.&nbsp; He transported his hearers beyond the region of
argument, and leaving all their cavils and prejudices
immeasurably behind, rapt them away to the third heaven of
ecstasy!</p>
<p>The secret of all this power is found in the preacher&rsquo;s
piety.&nbsp; He was a man of eminent faith and holiness.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;things new and old&rdquo; for the edification of his
hearers, he &ldquo;brought forth out of the treasure of his own
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The love of God within him imparted to his
preaching a wonderful unction.&nbsp; His splendid mental
creations were instinct with the inspiration of sanctified
feeling.&nbsp; This divine anointing often rendered him superior
to himself, clothed him with a superhuman energy, till he seemed
a messenger from the other world.&nbsp; The man was lost in his
theme.&nbsp; Art was swallowed up in the whirlpool of excited
feeling.&nbsp; The audience were swept irresistibly along by the
current of the discourse; acknowledging, by tears and groans, the
preacher&rsquo;s hold upon their hearts; and sometimes losing all
self-control, and bursting into the most extravagant expressions
of wonder and delight.&nbsp; On this subject take the language of
one, who, from personal acquaintance with Mr. Evans, was
qualified to form a correct estimate of his character as a
Christian minister:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was also an experimental preacher.&nbsp;
That a preacher feel his subject, constitutes one of his
excellencies; but that his sermon be deeply imbued with the
spiritual experience of the preacher, is the Crowning point of
his excellency.&nbsp; It is true, a person may speak well of the
distress of other people, but he will speak more powerfully of
his own distress.&nbsp; Persons may expatiate very eloquently on
the pleasant fragrance of the herbs and flowers of foreign lands,
but those who have themselves participated in the fragrant odors,
in the soft breezes of those countries, can describe them in an
infinitely superior manner, and to much greater advantage.&nbsp;
Many may speak fluently of the mercies of God, in providence and
grace&mdash;protecting, preserving, pardoning sinners, &amp;c.,
but those who have experienced a sense of the divine mercy in
their own souls can speak much better of it.&nbsp; Mr. Evans had
an experience of the things of God.&nbsp; Not only had he heard
of Calvary, <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>but in Calvary he lived; not only had he heard of the
bread of angels and of the corn of heaven, but this bread and
this corn were his daily food; not only had he heard of the river
of life, the streams whereof make glad the city of our God, but
the crystal waters of this river were his constant drink; not
only had he heard of the renewing influences of the grace of God,
but he himself had been made the subject of these
influences.&nbsp; He had experienced the operations of the Spirit
renovating his own heart, and therefore he could speak of them,
not as a matter of hearsay, but with the apostle&mdash;&lsquo;And
what our hands have handled of the Word of life, declare we unto
you.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Evans&rsquo; preaching was highly evangelical.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jesus Christ and him crucified,&rdquo; was the alpha and
omega of his ministry.&nbsp; The character of the following
sermons fully justifies that remarkable saying upon his
death-bed: &ldquo;I have never labored without blood in the
basin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every one of them is illustrative of some
important point in the economy of salvation.&nbsp; Every one of
them tends to humble the sinner, and exalt the grace of
God.&nbsp; Every one of them abounds with lofty views of the
Divine Justice and Mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is generally allowed,&rdquo; observes his friend,
&ldquo;that the people who are trained by a minister, and moulded
by his instructions, are a good evidence of the tendency of his
doctrine and ministry.&nbsp; In this view then, it is observed,
the church where he more statedly labored in Anglesea, and where
the most of his care and efforts were bestowed, were a people
mighty in the Scriptures; that they would converse well and
readily on most of the doctrines of the Christian faith; that
they labored much to improve in knowledge, and were active in the
cause of religion.&nbsp; These nearly all were Mr. Evans&rsquo;
own people; they were nurtured by him, and upon his ministerial
food they grew to be men, and were wholly according to the mold
of his doctrine.&nbsp; It has been remarked, &lsquo;that if
volumes upon volumes were written upon the subject of the
tendency of his ministry, it could never be exhibited to greater
advantage than has been done by himself, in those bright, clear,
and golden letters, which he has inscribed upon the people of his
charge at Llangevni.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>The
following extracts from Mr. Evans contain his views of the
evangelical over the legal style of preaching:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While a preacher inculcates duties in any
way but with a view to the promises of mercy, and of undeserved
strength, he is more like to a moral philosopher, than to the
apostles and preachers that have been a blessing unto men, such
as Whitefield, and hundreds who have been in a degree blessed in
the same doctrine, and by the same Spirit.&nbsp; It is not in the
duties we are to rest, but in Christ.&nbsp; &lsquo;Blessed are
the dead which die in the Lord&mdash;that they may rest from
their labors, <i>and their works follow them</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
was not in reliance upon their works they passed through the
river of death, as if presumptuously on a bundle of rushes, but
their works will meet them in the judgment day; to be weighed
there in the balance of the faith and love of Christ; and they
will be there as witnesses on the part of the saints, bearing
testimony that the love of Christ constrained them to live to him
that died for them and was raised again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By endeavoring to avoid the bog, you sink
in the quicksands&mdash;while you are hiding the system of grace,
and casting it, as it were, into the shade&mdash;duties without
faith are not acceptable, for &lsquo;Without faith it is
impossible to please God.&rsquo;&nbsp; I compare you to a
dry-goods merchant, who should hang up a piece of white cloth
over the shelves of his store, where the cloths, fine linen,
silks, &amp;c., are kept, and thus hiding every article in his
store, without exposing any thing to the view of his customers,
yet he would stand at the counter, and address them in the
language of surprise, Why do you not buy here, for I know you
have wherewith?&nbsp; So some preach, standing like the
store-keeper at the counter, saying, while the doctrine of grace
is kept put of sight, Why do you not buy here? for we know that
you have the money of ability; but you spend your money in the
shops of the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the
pride of life.&nbsp; But they reply, What shall we buy, sir? you
tell us that there is salvation in your store&mdash;and fine
linen wrought out from Bethlehem to Calvary, and white raiment;
gold and pearls, and food and drink indeed; but you hide them
under the vail: bring them to the counter, and open them before
us; show us, carefully and plainly, whence this salvation
proceeds, and by what means it has been procured;&mdash;has it
been expensive to some one, seeing it is free for us?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Once
more:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I compare such preachers to a miner, who
should go to the quarry where he raised the ore, and taking his
sledge in his hand, should endeavor to form bars of iron of the
ore in its rough state, without a furnace to melt it, or a
rolling-mill to roll it out, or molds to cast the metal, and
conform the casts to their patterns.&nbsp; The gospel is like a
form or mold, and sinners are to be melted, as it were, and cast
into it.&nbsp; &lsquo;But ye have obeyed from the heart that form
of doctrine which was delivered you,&rsquo; <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a> or into which you were delivered, as is
the marginal reading, so that your hearts ran into the
mold.&nbsp; Evangelical preachers have, in the name of Christ, a
mold or form to cast the minds of men into; as Solomon, the
vessels of the temple.&nbsp; The Sadducees and Pharisees had
their forms, and legal preachers have their forms; but
evangelical preachers should bring with them the &lsquo;form of
sound words,&rsquo; so that, if the hearers believe, or are
melted into it, Christ may be formed in their hearts&mdash;then
they will be as born of the truth, and the image of the truth
will appear in their sentiments and experience, and in their
conduct in the church, in the family, and in the
neighborhood.&nbsp; Preachers without the mold, are all those who
do not preach all the points of the gospel of the grace of
God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christmas Evans was in labors more abundant than any of his
Welsh contemporaries.&nbsp; We have stated in the memoir, that
while in Anglesea, he frequently preached five times a day, and
walked twenty miles.&nbsp; During his ministry, he made forty
journeys from North to South Wales, and preached one hundred and
sixty-three associational sermons.&nbsp; It is wonderful that his
extensive travels and arduous labors did not hurry him to the
grave before he had lived out half his days.&nbsp; But he had a
firm and vigorous constitution; and having borne the burden and
the heat of the day, the Master sustained him in the vineyard
till the setting of the sun.</p>
<p>And his labors were as successful as they were
extensive.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sound of heaven,&rdquo; remarks his
friend &ldquo;was to be heard in his sermons.&nbsp; He studied
his discourses well; he &lsquo;sought to find out acceptable
words, even words of truth;&rsquo; and the Holy Ghost attended
his ministry in an extraordinary manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few men of modern times have had a more numerous spiritual
family than he.&nbsp; Wherever he went, throughout all Wales,
multitudes <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>claimed him as their father in Christ.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
his day the Baptist associations acquired their great popularity,
and in his day arose a number of the most respectable ministers
ever known in the principality.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of them were
his own converts, and many of them had their talents inspired and
their zeal inflamed under his powerful ministry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Life and evangelical savor,&rdquo; said one of them,
&ldquo;attend Christmas Evans, wherever he is.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;None of us,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;understand and
comprehend the full extent of his usefulness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
celebrated Robert Hall mentioned his talents in terms of high
commendation, and ranked him among the first men of his
age.&nbsp; A Congregational clergyman, who was well acquainted
with him, speaks of him as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He is a connecting link between the
beginning and the ending of this century. <a
name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a>&nbsp; He has the light, the talent, and
the taste of the beginning, and has received every new light that
has appeared since.&nbsp; He was enabled to accompany the career
of religious knowledge in the morning, and also to follow its
rapid strides in the evening.&nbsp; In this he is unlike every
other preacher of the day: the morning and evening light of this
wonderful century meet in him.&nbsp; He had strength to climb up
to the top of Carmel in the morning, and remain there during the
heat of the day, and see the fire consuming the sacrifice and
licking up the water; his strength continued, by the hand of the
Lord, so that he could descend from the mount in the evening, and
run without fainting before the king&rsquo;s chariot to
Jezreel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We conclude this brief and somewhat imperfect portraiture with
the following characteristic paragraph from the pen of Mr. Evans,
illustrative of his views, not only of the right kind of pulpit
ministration, but also of the injurious influence and tendency of
the principal theological controversies which during his day
agitated the Baptist churches in the principality of
Wales:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I consider that a remarkable day has begun
upon Wales.&nbsp; The dawn of this day was with Vavasor Powell
and Walter Caradork; the former amongst the Baptists and the
latter amongst the Independents (Congregationalists).&nbsp;
Several churches were gathered in both denominations in the
twilight of morning.&nbsp; But when Rowlands and Harris
rose&mdash;it was the sunrising of this revival day.&nbsp; <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Mr. Jones, of
Pontypool, was one of the sons of the sunrising.&nbsp; About ten
or eleven o&rsquo;clock, a host of Baptists, Calvinistic
Methodists, and Congregationalists, arose; and among this class I
had the honor of entering the field.&nbsp; The day was
warm&mdash;the sermons and prayers were short, and the doctrine
was evangelical.&nbsp; But I have reached the evening, and the
day is greatly cooled.&nbsp; Power, tenderness, and the cross of
Christ, marked the sermons in the morning; but length and
tediousness are the distinguishing features of the prayers and
sermons in the evening.&nbsp; It was too warm to preach two hours
in the heat of the day.&nbsp; It appears, also, that talents are
become much weaker and more effeminate as the evening spreads its
shades.&nbsp; Beyond a doubt, the preaching of intricate
points&mdash;something like questions concerning the law, and
endless genealogies, have been the means of cooling the work and
the workmen in the evening of the day.&nbsp; They will now lift
up their heads and talk to every traveller that passes the field;
and towards Merionethshire, they will inquire, &lsquo;Dost thou
know any thing about Sandemanianism?&rsquo; and in other
districts they will ask, &lsquo;Dost thou know something about
Williamsism <a name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a> and Fullerism?&rsquo; and in
consequence you may see young doctors many, springing up, talking
like learned Lilliputians.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some say that Christ died
for all, and others that it was for his church he died; but the
truth is this,&rsquo; said the Lilliputians: &lsquo;he did not
die for any man, <i>but for the sin of all men</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I was there also on the great platform of this period, but I
dared not condemn all systems by a sweeping sentence of
infallibility, and take the bagpipe under my arm, as some were
disposed to do, and cry down every new voice without proving
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Prove all things.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

79</span>SERMONS OF CHRISTMAS EVANS.<br />
A New translation from the Welsh.INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> presenting to the public a
selection from the sermons of Christmas Evans, we find ourselves
embarrassed by two circumstances:</p>
<p>First.&mdash;It is impossible to exhibit on paper the
peculiarly forcible elocution of the author.&nbsp; Some of the
most effective discourses ever delivered seem comparatively
powerless when perused afterward in private.&nbsp; This
observation is verified in the case of the two most remarkable
pulpit orators of modern times, George Whitefield and John
Summerfield.&nbsp; Their spoken eloquence was like the breathings
of the seraphim, but their printed sermons are of no very
extraordinary character.&nbsp; Like them, Mr. Evans was much
indebted, for his success, to a very popular and powerful
delivery.&nbsp; His appearance in the pulpit was fine and
commanding; his voice, one of unrivalled compass and melody; his
gesticulation, always easy, appropriate, and forcible; and when
he warmed under the inspiration of his theme, his large bright
eye shot fire through the assembly.&nbsp; But the sermons are now
divested of all these auxiliary accompaniments; and without the
prophet before us, we may wonder at the effects attributed to his
message.&nbsp; The following selections will give the reader at
least a tolerable idea of Mr. Evans&rsquo; modes of thought and
illustration; but if he would have any adequate conception of the
splendid phantasmagora in process of exhibition, he must imagine
the burning lamp within the scenes.</p>
<p>But the greater difficulty is the impossibility of a perfect
translation.&nbsp; Genius is proverbially eccentric.&nbsp; Mr.
Evans&rsquo; style is altogether unique.&nbsp; The structure of
his sentences is very original.&nbsp; None of his countrymen
approximated his peculiar mode of expression.&nbsp; It would be
exceedingly difficult for any man, however well qualified to
translate other Welsh authors, to render him into English, with
the preservation, everywhere, of his spirit.&nbsp; The <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>writer at
first thought of publishing a selection from his sermons as
translated by J. Davis; but upon examination, that translation
was found so faulty, that it was deemed expedient, if possible,
to produce a new.&nbsp; In pursuance of this purpose he obtained
the aid of a friend, whose excellent literary taste, and accurate
acquaintance with both languages, constitute a sufficient
guarantee for the general correctness of the following
translation.&nbsp; It lays no claim to perfection, though it is
at least free from the most obvious and glaring faults of Mr.
Davis&rsquo; version.&nbsp; Some of the nicest shades of thought
are inevitably lost, and many of the startling metaphors and
splendid allegories have doubtless suffered some diminution of
their original force and beauty; but the writer trusts that
enough of the author&rsquo;s spirit is retained to furnish a
pretty correct idea of his talents, and render the book
acceptable to the reader.</p>
<p>With these apologetic remarks, we commit the sermons of
Christmas Evans to the press; praying that they may be
accompanied with something of the same Divine unction, as when,
in their original delivery by the author, they &ldquo;set the
land of Cambria on fire.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

THE TIME OF REFORMATION.</h3>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Until the
time of reformation</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. ix. 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ceremonies pertaining to the
service of God under the Sinaic dispensation were entirely
typical in their character; mere figures of Christ, the
&ldquo;High-priest of good things to come, by a greater and more
perfect tabernacle, not made with hands;&rdquo; who, &ldquo;not
by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has
entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sustaining such a relation to
other ages and events, they were necessarily imperfect,
consisting &ldquo;only in meats and drinks, and divers washings,
and carnal ordinances,&rdquo; not intended for perpetual
observance, but imposed upon the Jewish people merely
&ldquo;until the time of reformation,&rdquo; when the shadow
should give place to the substance, and a Greater than Moses
should &ldquo;make all things new.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us notice the
time of reformation, and the reformation itself.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Time may be divided into three parts; the Golden Age
before the fall, the Iron Age after the fall, and the
Messiah&rsquo;s Age of Jubilee.</p>
<p>In the Golden Age, the heavens and the earth were created; the
garden of Eden was planted; man was made in the image of God, and
placed in the garden to dress and to keep it; matrimony was
instituted; and God, resting from his labor, sanctified the
Seventh Day, as a day of holy rest to man.</p>
<p>The Iron Age was introduced by the temptation of a foreigner,
who obtruded himself into Paradise, and persuaded its happy
denizens to cast off the golden yoke of obedience and love to
God.&nbsp; Man, desiring independence, became a rebel against
Heaven, a miserable captive of sin and Satan, obnoxious to the
Divine displeasure, and exposed to eternal death.&nbsp; The law
was violated; <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>the image of God was lost, and the enemy came in like a
flood.&nbsp; All communication between the island of time and the
continent of immortality was cut off, and the unhappy exiles saw
no hope of crossing the ocean that intervened.</p>
<p>The Messiah&rsquo;s Age may be divided into three parts; the
time of Preparation, the time of Actual War, and the time of
Victory and Triumph.</p>
<p>The Preparation began with the dawning of the day in Eden,
when Messiah came in the ship of the Promise, and landed on the
island of Time, and notified its inhabitants of his gracious
intention to visit them again, and assume their nature, and live
and die among them; to break their covenant allegiance to the
prince of the iron yoke; and deliver to them the charter, signed
and sealed with his own blood, for the redemption and renovation
of their island, and the restoration of its suspended intercourse
with the land of Eternal Life.&nbsp; The motto inscribed upon the
banners of this age was,&mdash;&ldquo;He shall bruise thy heel,
and thou shalt bruise his head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Jehovah
thundered forth his hatred of sin from the thick darkness, and
wrote his curse in fire upon the face of heaven; while rivers of
sacrificial blood proclaimed the miserable state of man, and his
need of a costlier atonement than mere humanity could
offer.&nbsp; Here also the spirit of Messiah fell upon the
prophets, leading them to search diligently for the way of
deliverance, and enabling them to &ldquo;testify beforehand of
the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came the season of Actual War.&nbsp; &ldquo;Messiah the
Prince&rdquo; was born in Bethlehem, wrapped in swaddling-bands,
and laid in a manger.&nbsp; The Great Deliverer was &ldquo;made
of a woman, made under the law, to redeem those that were under
the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With an almighty hand, he laid hold on the works of the devil,
unlocked the iron furnace, and broke the brazen bands
asunder.&nbsp; He opened his mouth, and the deaf heard, the blind
saw, the dumb spake, the lame walked, and the lepers were
cleansed.&nbsp; In the house of Jairus, in the street of Nain,
and in the burial-ground of Bethany, his word was mightier than
death; and the damsel on her bed, the young man on his bier, and
Lazarus in his tomb, rising to second life, were but the earnests
of his future triumph.&nbsp; The diseases of sin he healed, the
iron chains of guilt he shattered, and all the horrible caves of
human <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>corruption and misery were opened by the Heavenly
Warrior.&nbsp; He took our yoke, and bore it away upon his own
shoulder, and cast it broken into the bottomless pit.&nbsp; He
felt in his hands and his feet the nails, and in his side the
spear.&nbsp; The iron entered into his soul, but the corrosive
power of his blood destroyed it, and shall ultimately eat away
all the iron in the kingdom of death.&nbsp; Behold him hanging on
Calvary, nailing upon his cross three bills; the handwriting of
the law which was against us, the oath of our allegiance to the
prince of darkness, and the charter of the &ldquo;everlasting
covenant;&rdquo; fulfilling the first, breaking the second, and
sealing the third with his blood!</p>
<p>Now begins the scene of Victory and Triumph.&nbsp; On the
morning of the third day, the Conqueror is seen &ldquo;coming
from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has
&ldquo;trodden the wine-press alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the might of
his single arm, he has routed the hosts of hell, and spoiled the
dominions of death.&nbsp; The iron castle of the foe is
demolished, and the hero returns from the war, &ldquo;glorious in
his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his
strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; He enters the gates of the everlasting
city, amid the rejoicing of angels, and the shouts of his
redeemed.&nbsp; And still he rides forth in the chariot of his
grace, &ldquo;conquering, and to conquer.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
two-edged sword issues from his mouth, and in his train follow
the victorious armies of heaven.&nbsp; Lo! before him fall the
altars of idols, and the temples of devils; and the slaves of sin
are becoming the servants and sons of the living God; and the
proud skeptic beholds, wonders, believes, and adores; and the
blasphemer begins to pray, and the persecutor is melted into
penitence and love, and the wolf comes and lays him down gently
by the side of the Iamb.&nbsp; And Messiah shall never quit the
field, till he has completed the conquest, and swallowed up death
in victory.&nbsp; In his &ldquo;vesture dipped in blood,&rdquo;
he shall pursue the armies of Gog and Magog on the field of
Armageddon, and break the iron teeth of the beast of power, and
cast down Babylon as a millstone into the sea, and bind the old
serpent in the lake of fire and brimstone, and raise up to life
immortal the tenants of the grave.&nbsp; Then shall the New
Jerusalem, the metropolis of Messiah&rsquo;s golden empire,
descend from heaven, adorned with all the jewelry of creation,
guarded at every gate by angelic sentinels, and enlightened by
the glory of God and <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of the Lamb; and the faithful shall
dwell within its walls, and sin, and sorrow, and death, shall be
shut out for ever!</p>
<p>Then shall time be swallowed up in eternity.&nbsp; The
righteous shall inherit life everlasting, and the ungodly shall
find their portion in the second death.&nbsp; Time is the age of
the visible world; eternity is the age of the invisible
God.&nbsp; All things in time are changeful; all things in
eternity are immutable.&nbsp; If you pass from time to eternity,
without faith in Christ, without love to God, an enemy to prayer,
an enemy to holiness, &ldquo;unpurged and unforgiven,&rdquo; so
you must ever remain.&nbsp; Now is the season of that blessed
change, for which myriads shall sing everlasting anthems of
praise.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden
not your hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; To-day the office is open; if you
have any business with the Governor, make no delay.&nbsp; Now he
has time to talk with the woman of Samaria by the well, and the
penitent thief upon the cross.&nbsp; Now he is ready to forgive
your sins, and renew your souls, and make you meet to become
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.&nbsp; Now he
waits to wash the filthy, and feed the hungry, and clothe the
naked, and raise the humble, and quicken the spiritually dead,
and enrich the poor and wretched, and reconcile enemies by his
blood.&nbsp; He came to unloose your bands, and open to you the
gates of Eden; condemned for your acquittal, and slain for the
recovery of your forfeited immortality.&nbsp; The design of all
the traveling from heaven to earth, and from earth to heaven, is
the salvation of that which was lost, the restoration of
intercourse and amity between the Maker and the worm.&nbsp; This
is the chief of the ways of God to man, ancient in its origin,
wise in its contrivance, dear in its accomplishment, powerful in
its application, gracious in its influence, and everlasting in
its results.&nbsp; Christ is riding in his chariot of salvation,
through the land of destruction and death, clothed in the majesty
of mercy, and offering eternal life to all who will
believe.&nbsp; O captives of evil! now is the accepted time; now
is the day of salvation; now is the year of jubilee; now is the
age of deliverance; now is &ldquo;the time of
reformation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; All the prophets speak of something within the veil,
to be manifested in due time; the advent of a Divine agent in a
future age, to accomplish a glorious
&ldquo;reformation.&rdquo;&nbsp; They represent him as a prince;
a hero; a high-priest; a branch growing out of dry ground; a
child toying with the asp and the lion, and leading the <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>wolf and the
lamb together.&nbsp; The bill of the reformation had been
repeatedly read by the prophets, but its passage required the
descent of the Lord from heaven.&nbsp; None but himself could
effect the change of the dispensation.&nbsp; None but himself had
the authority and the power to remove the first, and establish
the second.&nbsp; He whose voice once shook the earth, speaks
again, and heaven is shaken.&nbsp; He whose footsteps once
kindled Sinai into flame, descends again, and Calvary is red with
blood.&nbsp; The God of the ancient covenant introduces a new,
which is to abide for ever.&nbsp; The Lord of the temple alone
could change the furniture and the service from the original
pattern shown to Moses in the mount; and six days before the
rending of the veil, significant of the abrogation of the old
ceremonial, Moses came down upon a mountain in Palestine to
deliver up the pattern to him of whom he had received it on
Sinai, that he might nail it to his cross on Calvary; for the
&ldquo;gifts and sacrifices&rdquo; belonging to the legal
dispensation &ldquo;could not make him that did the service
perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; which stood only in
meats, and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances,
imposed on them until the time of reformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reformation signifieth &ldquo;the removal of those things
that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things
which cannot be shaken may remain;&rdquo; the abrogation of
&ldquo;carnal ordinances,&rdquo; which were local and temporal in
their nature, to make room for a spiritual worship, of universal
and perpetual adaptation.&nbsp; Henceforth the blood of bulls and
goats is superseded by the great reconciling sacrifice of the
Lamb of God, and outward forms and ceremonies give place to the
inward operations of a renovating and purifying Spirit.</p>
<p>To the Jewish church, the covenant of Sinai was a sort of
starry heaven.&nbsp; The Shekinah was its sun; the holy
festivals, its moon; and prophets, priests, and kings, its
stars.&nbsp; But Messiah, when he came, shook them all from their
spheres, and filled the firmament himself.&nbsp; He is our
&ldquo;Bright and Morning Star;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Sun of
Righteousness,&rdquo; rising upon us &ldquo;with healing in his
wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old covenant was an accuser and a judge, but offered no
pardon to the guilty.&nbsp; It revealed the corruption of the
natural heart, but provided no renovating and sanctifying
grace.&nbsp; It was a national institution, for the special
benefit of the seed of Abraham.&nbsp; It was a small vessel,
trading only with the land of Canaan.&nbsp; It <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>secured to a
few the temporal blessings of the promised possession, but never
delivered a single soul from eternal death; never bore a single
soul over to the heavenly inheritance.&nbsp; But the new covenant
is a covenant of grace and mercy, proffering forgiveness and a
clean heart, not on the ground of any carnal relationship, but
solely through faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Christianity is a
personal concern between each man and his God, and none but the
penitent believer has any right to its spiritual
privileges.&nbsp; It is adapted to Gentiles as well as Jews,
&ldquo;even as many as the Lord our God shall call.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Already has it rescued myriads from the bondage of sin, and
conveyed them over to the land of immortality; and its voyages of
grace shall continue to the end of time, &ldquo;bringing many
sons to glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old things are passed away, and all things are become
new.&rdquo;&nbsp; The circumcision of the flesh, made with hands,
has given place to the circumcision of the heart by the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; The Shekinah has departed from Mount Zion, but its
glory is illuminating the world.&nbsp; The sword of Joshua is
returned to its scabbard; and &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit,
which is the word of God,&rdquo; issues from the mouth of
Messiah, and subdues the people under him.&nbsp; The glorious
High-priesthood of Christ has superseded the sacerdotal office
among men.&nbsp; Aaron was removed from the altar by death before
his work was finished; but our High-priest still wears his
sacrificial vestments, and death has established him before the
mercy-seat, &ldquo;a priest for ever, after the order of
Melchisedec.&rdquo;&nbsp; The earthquake which shook mount
Calvary, and rent the veil of the temple, demolished &ldquo;the
middle wall of partition&rdquo; between Jews and Gentiles.&nbsp;
The incense which Jesus offered fills the temple, and the land of
Judea cannot confine its fragrance.&nbsp; The fountain which
burst forth in Jerusalem, has sent out its living streams into
every land; and the heat of summer cannot dry them up, nor the
frosts of winter congeal.</p>
<p>In short, all the vessels of the sanctuary are taken away by
the Lord of the temple.&nbsp; The &ldquo;twelve oxen,&rdquo;
bearing the &ldquo;molten sea,&rdquo; have given place to
&ldquo;the twelve apostles of the Lamb,&rdquo; proclaiming
&ldquo;the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sprinkled mercy-seat, with its
overshadowing and intensely-gazing cherubim, has given place to
&ldquo;the throne of grace,&rdquo; stained with the blood of a
costlier sacrifice, into which <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the angels desire to look.&nbsp; The
priest, the altar, the burnt-offering, the table of shew-bread,
and the golden candlestick, have given place to the better things
of the new dispensation introduced by the Son of God, of which
they were only the figures and the types.&nbsp; Behold, the glory
is gone up from the temple, and rests upon Jesus on mount Tabor;
and Moses and Elias are there, with Peter, and James, and John;
and the representatives of the old covenant are communing with
the apostles of the new, and the transfigured Christ is the
medium of the communication; and a voice of majestic music,
issuing from &ldquo;the excellent glory,&rdquo;
proclaims&mdash;&ldquo;This is my beloved Son; hear ye
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake
unto our fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken
unto us by his Son.&rdquo;&nbsp; Behold him nailed to the cross,
and hear him cry&mdash;&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
voice which shook Sinai is shaking Calvary.&nbsp; Heaven and hell
are in conflict, and earth trembles at the shock of battle.&nbsp;
The Prince of Life expires, and the sun puts on his robes of
mourning.&nbsp; Gabriel! descend from heaven, and explain to us
the wondrous emblem!&nbsp; As set the sun at noon on Golgotha,
making preternatural night throughout the land of Palestine; so
shall the empire of sin and death be darkened, and their light
shall be quenched at meridian.&nbsp; As the Sun of Righteousness,
rising from the night of the grave on the third morning, brings
life and immortality to light; so shall &ldquo;the day-spring
from on high&rdquo; yet dawn upon our gloomy vale, and &ldquo;the
power of his resurrection&rdquo; shall reanimate the dust of
every cemetery!</p>
<p>He that sitteth upon the throne hath
spoken&mdash;&ldquo;Behold, I make all things new!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The reformation includes not only the abrogation of the old, but
also the introduction of the new.&nbsp; It gives us a new
Mediator, a new covenant of grace, a new way of salvation, a new
heart of flesh, a new heaven and a new earth.&nbsp; It has
established a new union, by a new medium, between God and
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and
we beheld his glory, the glory as of the Only Begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Forasmuch as
the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself
likewise took part of the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God was
manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up
into glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was a new thing under the sun; the
&ldquo;Son of <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>man&rdquo; bearing the &ldquo;express image&rdquo; of
the living God; bearing it untarnished through the world; through
the temptations and sorrows of such a wilderness as humanity
never trod before; through the unknown agony of Olivet, and the
supernatural gloom of Golgotha, and the dark dominion of the king
of terrors; to the heaven of heavens; where he sits, the adorable
representative of two worlds, the union of God and man!&nbsp;
Thence he sends forth the Holy Spirit, to collect &ldquo;the
travail of his soul,&rdquo; and lead them into all truth, and
bring them to Zion with songs of everlasting joy.&nbsp; See them,
the redeemed of the Lord, flocking, as returning doves upon the
wing, &ldquo;to the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living
God; and to the spirits of just men made perfect; and to an
innumerable company of angels; and to Jesus, the Mediator of the
new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh
better things than that of Abel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, join the joyful multitude!&nbsp; The year of jubilee is
come.&nbsp; The veil is rent asunder.&nbsp; The way into the
holiest is laid open.&nbsp; The blood of Jesus is on the
mercy-seat.&nbsp; The Lamb newly slain is in the midst of the
throne.&nbsp; Go ye with boldness into his gracious
presence.&nbsp; Lo, the King is your brother, and for you has he
stained his robe with blood!&nbsp; That robe alone can clothe
your naked souls, and shield them in the day of burning.&nbsp;
Awake! awake! put on the Lord Jesus Christ!&nbsp; The covenant of
Sinai cannot save you from wrath.&nbsp; Descent from Abraham
cannot entitle you to the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye must
be born again;&rdquo; &ldquo;born, not of the flesh, nor of the
will of men, but of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; You must have a new heart,
and become a new creation in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; This is the
promise of the Father.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is the dear redeeming grace,<br />
For every sinner free!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many reformations have expired with the reformers.&nbsp; But
our Great Reformer &ldquo;ever liveth&rdquo; to carry on his
reformation, till his enemies become his footstool, and death and
hell are cast into the lake of fire.&nbsp; He will finish the
building of his church.&nbsp; When he laid the &ldquo;chief
corner-stone&rdquo; on Calvary, the shock jarred the earth, and
awoke the dead, and shook the nether world with terror; but when
he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of
&ldquo;grace!&rdquo; the dominion of Death and Hades shall
perish, and the last captive shall escape, and the song of the
bursting sepulchre <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>shall be sweeter than the chorus of the morning
stars!&nbsp; Even now, there are new things in heaven; the Lamb
from the slaughter, alive &ldquo;in the midst of the
throne;&rdquo; worshipped by innumerable seraphim and cherubim,
and adored by the redeemed from earth; his name the wonder of
angels, the terror of devils, and the hope of men; his praise the
&ldquo;new song,&rdquo; which shall constitute the employment of
eternity!</p>

THE TRIUMPH OF CALVARY</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Who is this that cometh from Edom</i>,
<i>with dyed garments from Bozrah</i>? <i>this that is glorious
in his apparel</i>, <i>travelling in the greatness of his
strength</i>?&nbsp; <i>I that speak in righteousness</i>,

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> passage is one of the
sublimest in the Bible.&nbsp; Not more majestic and overwhelming
is the voice of God issuing from the burning bush.&nbsp; It
represents &ldquo;the Captain of our salvation,&rdquo; left alone
in the heat of battle, marching victoriously through the broken
columns of the foe, bursting the bars asunder, bearing away the
brazen gates, and delivering by conquest the captives of sin and
death.&nbsp; Let us first determine the events to which our text
relates, and then briefly explain the questions and answers which
it contains.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; We have here a wonderful victory, obtained by Christ,
in the city of Bozrah, in the land of Edom.&nbsp; Our first
inquiry concerns the time and the place of that achievement.</p>
<p>Some of the prophecies are literal, and others are
figurative.&nbsp; Some of them are already fulfilled, and others
are in daily process of fulfilment.&nbsp; Respecting this
prophecy, divines disagree.&nbsp; Some think it is a description
of Christ&rsquo;s conflict and victory, without the gates of
Jerusalem, eighteen centuries ago; and others understand it as
referring to the great battle of Armageddon, predicted in the
Apocalypse, and yet to be consummated before the end of the
world.</p>
<p>I am not willing to pass by mount Calvary, and Joseph&rsquo;s
new tomb, on my way to the field of Armageddon; nor am I willing
to <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>pause
at the scene of the crucifixion and the ascension, without going
farther on to the final conquest of the foe.&nbsp; I believe
Divine inspiration has included both events in the text; the
victory already won on Calvary, and the victory yet to be
accomplished in Armageddon; the finished victory of
Messiah&rsquo;s passion, and the progressive victory of his
gospel and his grace.</p>
<p>The chief difficulty, in understanding some parts of the word
of God, arises from untranslated words; many of which are found
in our own version, as well as in that of our English
neighbors.&nbsp; For instance&mdash;in Mat. ii. 23, it is said,
&ldquo;He came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, He shall be called
a Nazarene.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where in the prophets is it predicted
that Christ shall be called a Nazarene?&nbsp; Nowhere.&nbsp; When
the proper names are translated, the difficulty vanishes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He came and dwelt in a city called <i>plantation</i>, that
it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, He shall
be called <i>the Branch</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This name is given him
by Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah.&nbsp; Now this is precisely
the difficulty that occurs in our text, and the translation of
the terms unties the knot:&mdash;&ldquo;Who is this that cometh
from Edom,&rdquo; <i>red earth</i>&mdash;&ldquo;with dyed
garments from Bozrah,&rdquo; <i>tribulation</i>?</p>
<p>The former part of the text has reference to the victory of
Calvary; the latter part anticipates the battle and triumph of
Armageddon, mentioned in Rev. xvi. 16.&nbsp; The victory of
Calvary is consummated on the morning of the third day after the
crucifixion.&nbsp; The Conqueror comes up from the earth,
exclaiming:&mdash;&ldquo;I have trodden the winepress alone on
Calvary; and I will tread them in mine anger, and make them drunk
in my fury, at the battle of Armageddon.&nbsp; I will overtake
and destroy the beast, and the false prophet, and that old
serpent the devil, with all their hosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the tide of battle turned, on the field of Waterloo, the
Duke of Wellington mounted his horse, and pursued the vanquished
foe.&nbsp; So Isaiah&rsquo;s Conqueror, having routed the powers
of hell on Calvary, pursues and destroys them on the field of
Armageddon.&nbsp; Here he is represented as a hero on foot, a
prince without an army; but John, the revelator, saw him riding
on a white horse, and followed by the armies of heaven, all on
white horses, and not a footman among them.</p>
<p>The victory of Calvary is like the blood of atonement in the
<a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>sanctuary.&nbsp; The cherubim were some of them looking
one way, and some the other, but all were looking on the atoning
blood.&nbsp; Thus all the great events of time&mdash;all the
trials and triumphs of God&rsquo;s people&mdash;those which
happened before, those which have happened since, and those which
are yet to happen, are all looking toward the wrestling of
Gethsemane, the conflict of Golgotha, and the triumph of
Olivet.&nbsp; The escape from Egypt, and the return from Babylon,
looked forward to the cross of Christ; and the faith of the
perfect man of Uz hung on a risen Redeemer.&nbsp; The Christian
martyrs overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and all their
victories were in virtue of one great achievement.&nbsp; The tomb
of Jesus is the birthplace of his people&rsquo;s immortality, and
the power which raised him from the dead shall open the
sepulchres of all his saints.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy dead men shall
live; together with my dead body shall they arise.&nbsp; Awake
and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of
herbs, and the earth shall cast forth her dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ offered himself a sacrifice for us, and drank the cup
of God&rsquo;s righteous indignation in our stead.&nbsp; He was
trodden by Almighty justice, as a cluster of grapes, in the
winepress of the law, till the vessels of mercy overflowed with
the wine of peace and pardon, which has made thousands of
contrite and humble spirits &ldquo;rejoice with joy unspeakable
and full of glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; He suffered for us, that we might
triumph with him.&nbsp; But our text describes him as a king and
a conqueror.&nbsp; He was, at once, the dying victim and the
immortal victor.&nbsp; In &ldquo;the power of an endless
life,&rdquo; he was standing by the altar, when the sacrifice was
burning.&nbsp; He was alive in his sacerdotal vestments, with his
golden censer in his hand.&nbsp; He was alive in his kingly
glory, with his sword and his sceptre in his hand.&nbsp; He was
alive in his conquering prowess, and had made an end of sin, and
bruised the head of the serpent, and spoiled the principalities
and powers of hell, and turned the vanquished hosts of the prince
of darkness down to the winepress of the wrath of Almighty
God.&nbsp; Then, on the morning of the third day, when he arose
from the dead, and made a show of them openly&mdash;then began
the year of jubilee with power!</p>
<p>After the prophets of ancient times had long gazed through the
mists of futurity, at the sufferings of Christ and the glory that
should follow, a company of them were gathered together on the
summit <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>of
Calvary.&nbsp; They saw a host of enemies ascending the hill,
arrayed for battle, and most terrific in their aspect.&nbsp; In
the middle of the line was the law of God, fiery and exceeding
broad, and working wrath.&nbsp; On the right wing, was Beelzebub
with his troops of infernals; and on the left Caiaphas with his
Jewish priests, and Pilate with his Roman soldiers.&nbsp; The
rear was brought up by Death, the last enemy.&nbsp; When the holy
seers had espied this army, and perceived that it was drawing
nigh, they started back, and prepared for flight.&nbsp; As they
looked round, they saw the Son of God advancing with intrepid
step, having his face fixed on the hostile band.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Seest thou the danger that is before thee,&rdquo; said one
of the men of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tread them in mine
anger,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and trample them in my
fury.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; said the prophet;
He answered: &ldquo;I that speak in righteousness, mighty to
save.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt thou venture to the battle
alone?&rdquo; asked the seer.&nbsp; The Son of God replied:
&ldquo;I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered there
was none to uphold; therefore mine own arm shall bring salvation
unto me; and my fury it shall uphold me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At
what point wilt thou commence thy attack?&rdquo; inquired the
anxious prophet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will first meet the Law,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;and pass under its curse: for lo! I come to do
thy will, O God.&nbsp; When I shall have succeeded at the centre
of the line, the colors will turn in my favor.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
saying he moved forward.&nbsp; Instantly the thunderings of Sinai
were heard, and the whole band of prophets quaked with
terror.&nbsp; But he advanced, undaunted, amidst the gleaming
lightnings.&nbsp; For a moment he was concealed from view; and
the banner of wrath waved above in triumph.&nbsp; Suddenly the
scene was changed.&nbsp; A stream of blood poured forth from his
wounded side, and put out all the fires of Sinai.&nbsp; The flag
of peace was now seen unfurled, and consternation filled the
ranks of his foes.&nbsp; He then crushed, with his bruised heel,
the old serpent&rsquo;s head; and put all the infernal powers to
flight.&nbsp; With his iron rod he dashed to pieces the enemies
on the left wing, like a potter&rsquo;s vessel.&nbsp; Death still
remained, who thought himself invincible, having hitherto
triumphed over all.&nbsp; He came forward, brandishing his sting,
which he had whetted on Sinai&rsquo;s tables of stone.&nbsp; He
darted it at the Conqueror, but it turned down, and hung like the
flexible lash of a whip.&nbsp; Dismayed, he retreated to the
grave, his palace, into which the Conqueror pursued.&nbsp; In a
dark corner of <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>his den, he sat on his throne of moldering skulls, and
called upon the worms, his hitherto faithful allies, to aid him
in the conflict; but they replied&mdash;&ldquo;His flesh shall
see no corruption!&rdquo;&nbsp; The scepter fell from his
hand.&nbsp; The Conqueror seized him, bound him, and condemned
him to the lake of fire; and then rose from the grave, followed
by a band of released captives, who came forth after his
resurrection to be witnesses of the victory which he had won. <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a></p>
<p>John in the Apocalypse did not look so far back as the
treading of this winepress; but John saw him on his white horse,
decked with his many crowns, his eyes like flames of fire, a
two-edged sword in his hand, in the van of the armies of heaven,
going forth conquering and to conquer.&nbsp; This is the
fulfilment of his declaration in our text:&mdash;&ldquo;For I
will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my
fury.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the beginning of the jubilee, the
battle of Armageddon, wherein all heathen idolatry and
superstition shall be overthrown, and the beast and the false
prophet shall be discomfited, and the devil arid his legions
shall be taken prisoners by Emmanuel, and shut up in the
bottomless pit.&nbsp; He who hath conquered principalities and
powers on Calvary, will not leave the field, till he make all his
enemies his footstool, and sway his scepter over a subject
universe.&nbsp; Having sent forth the gospel from Jerusalem, he
accompanies it with the grace of his Holy Spirit; and it shall
not return unto him void, but shall accomplish that which he
pleaseth, and prosper in the thing whereto he hath sent it.</p>
<p>The victory of Armageddon is obtained by virtue of the victory
of Calvary.&nbsp; It is but the consummation of the same glorious
campaign; and the first decisive blow dealt on the prince of
darkness is a sure precursor of the final conquest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will meet thee again at Philippi!&rdquo; said the ghost
of Julius C&aelig;sar to Brutus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will meet thee
again at Armageddon!&rdquo; saith the Son of God to Satan on
Calvary&mdash;&ldquo;I will meet thee in the engagement between
good and evil, grace and depravity, in every believer&rsquo;s
heart; in the contest of Divine Truth with human errors, of the
religion of God with the superstitions of men; in every sermon,
every revival, every missionary enterprise; in the spread and
glory of the gospel <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>in the latter day, I will meet thee; and the heel which
thou hast now bruised, shall crush thy head for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s deliverance is of God.&nbsp; Man had neither the
inclination nor the power.&nbsp; His salvation originated in the
Divine Love, and burst forth like an ocean from the fountains of
eternity.&nbsp; Satan, as a ravenous lion, had taken the prey,
and was running to his den with the bleeding sheep in his mouth;
but the Shepherd of Israel pursues him, overtakes him, and rends
him as if he were a kid.&nbsp; The declaration of war was made in
Eden:&mdash;&ldquo;I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
and between thy seed and her seed; thou shalt bruise his heel,
and he shall bruise thy head.&rdquo;&nbsp; It shall be
fulfilled.&nbsp; The league with hell, and the covenant with
death shall not stand.&nbsp; The rebellion shall be quelled, the
conspiracy shall be broken, and the strong man armed shall yield
the citadel to a stronger.&nbsp; The works of the devil shall be
destroyed, and the prey shall be taken from the teeth of the
terrible.&nbsp; The house of David shall grow stronger and
stronger, and the house of Saul shall grow weaker and weaker,
till the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdom of our
God and of his Christ, and Satan shall be bound in chains of
darkness, and cast into the lake of fire.&nbsp; All the enemies
of Zion shall be vanquished, and the forfeited favor of God shall
be recovered, and the lost territory of peace and holiness and
immortality shall be restored to man.</p>
<p>This campaign is carried on at the expense of the government
of heaven.&nbsp; The treasury is inexhaustible; the arms are
irresistible; therefore the victory is sure.&nbsp; The Almighty
King has descended; he has taken the city of Bozrah; he has
swayed his scepter over Edom; he has risen victoriously, and gone
up with a shout, as the leader of all the army.&nbsp; This is but
the pledge and the earnest of his future achievements.&nbsp; In
the battle of Armageddon, he shall go forth as a mighty man; he
shall stir up jealousy as a man of war; and he shall prevail
against his enemies.&nbsp; They shall be turned back&mdash;they
shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images&mdash;that
say unto molten images, &ldquo;Ye are our gods!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
he will open the blind eyes, and bring the prisoners from the
prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the
prison-house.&nbsp; He will make bare his holy arm&mdash;he will
show the sword in that hand which was hidden under the scarlet
robe&mdash;he will manifest his power in the destruction of his
enemies, and the salvation of his <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>people.&nbsp; As certainly as he hath
shed his blood on Calvary, shall he stain all his raiment with
the blood of his foes on the field of Armageddon.&nbsp; As
certainly as he hath drained the cup of wrath, and received the
baptism of suffering, on Calvary, shall he wield the iron rod of
justice, and sway the golden sceptre of mercy, on the field of
Armageddon.&nbsp; Already the sword is drawn, and the decisive
blow is struck, and the helmet of Apollyon is cleft, and the
bonds of iniquity are cut asunder.&nbsp; Already the fire is
kindled, and all the powers of hell cannot quench it.&nbsp; It
has fallen from heaven; it is consuming the camp of the foe; it
is inflaming the hearts of men; it is renovating the earth, and
purging away the curse.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bright and Morning
Star&rdquo; has risen on Calvary; and soon &ldquo;the Son of
Righteousness&rdquo; shall shine on the field of Armageddon; and
the darkness that covers the earth, and the gross darkness that
covers the people, shall melt away; and Mohammedism, and
Paganism, and Popery, with their prince, the devil, shall seek
shelter in the bottomless pit!</p>
<p>After a battle, we are anxious to learn who is dead, who is
wounded, and who is missing from the ranks.&nbsp; In the
engagement of Messiah with Satan and his allies on Calvary,
Messiah&rsquo;s heel was bruised, but Satan and his allies
received a mortal wound in the head.&nbsp; The head denotes
wisdom, cunning, power, government.&nbsp; The devil, sin, and
death have lost their dominion over the believer in Christ, since
the achievement of Calvary.&nbsp; There is now no condemnation,
no fear of hell.&nbsp; But the serpent, though his head is
bruised, may be able to move his tail, and alarm those of little
faith.&nbsp; Yet it cannot last long.&nbsp; The wound is mortal,
and the triumph is sure.&nbsp; On Calvary the dragon&rsquo;s head
was crushed by the Captain of our salvation; after the battle of
Armageddon, his tail shall shake no more!</p>
<p>There is no discharge in this war.&nbsp; He that enlisteth
under the banner of the cross must endure faithful until
death&mdash;must not lay aside his arms till death is swallowed
up in victory.&nbsp; Then shall every conqueror bear the image of
the heavenly, and wear the crown instead of the cross, and carry
the palm instead of the spear.&nbsp; Let us be strong in the
Lord, and in the power of his might, that we may be able to stand
in the evil day; and after all the war is over, to stand accepted
in the Beloved, that we may reign with him for ever and ever!</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>II.&nbsp; It remains for us to explain, very briefly,
the glorious colloquy in the text&mdash;the interrogatives of the
church, and the answers of Messiah.</p>
<p>How great was the wonder and joy of Mary, when she met the
Master at the tomb, clothed in immortality, where she thought to
find him shrouded in death!&nbsp; How unspeakable was the
astonishment and rapture of the disciples, when their Lord, whom
they had so recently buried, came into the house where they were
assembled, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Peace be unto you!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such are the feelings which the church is represented as
expressing in this sublime colloquy with the Captain of her
salvation.&nbsp; He has travelled into the land of tribulation;
he has gone down to the dust of death; but lo, he returns a
conqueror, the golden sceptre of love in his left hand, the iron
rod of justice in his right, and on his head a crown of many
stars.&nbsp; The church beholds him with great amazement and
delight.&nbsp; She lately followed him, weeping, to the cross,
and mourned over his body in the tomb; but now she beholds him
risen indeed, having destroyed death, and him that had the power
of death&mdash;that is, the devil.&nbsp; She goes forth to meet
him with songs of rejoicing, as the daughters of Israel went out
to welcome David, when he returned from the valley, with the head
of the giant in his hand, and the blood running down upon his
raiment.&nbsp; The choir of the church is divided into two bands;
which chant to each other in alternate strains.&nbsp; The right
hand division begins the glorious colloquy&mdash;&ldquo;Who is
this that cometh from Edom?&rdquo; and the left takes up the
interrogative, and repeats it with a variation&mdash;&ldquo;with
dyed garments from Bozrah?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This that is
glorious in his apparel?&rdquo; resumes the right-hand
company&mdash;&ldquo;glorious notwithstanding the tribulations he
hath endured?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Travelling in the greatness of
his strength?&rdquo; responds the left&mdash;&ldquo;strength
sufficient to unbar the gates of the grave, and liberate the
captives of corruption?&rdquo;&nbsp; The celestial Conqueror
pauses, and casts upon the company of the daughters of Zion a
look of infinite benignity; and with a voice of angel melody, and
more than angel majesty, he replies&mdash;&ldquo;I that speak in
righteousness, mighty to save!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now bursts the song
again, like the sound of many waters, from the
right&mdash;&ldquo;Wherefore art thou red in thine
apparel?&rdquo; and the response rolls back in melodized thunder
from the left&mdash;&ldquo;And thy garments like him that
treadeth in the wine-fat?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Divine hero
answers:&mdash;<a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&ldquo;I have trodden the wine-press alone; and of the
people there was none with me.&nbsp; Even Peter has left me, with
all his courage and affection; and as for John, to talk of love
is all that he can do.&nbsp; I have triumphed over principalities
and powers.&nbsp; I am wounded, but they are vanquished.&nbsp;
Behold the blood which I have lost! behold the spoils which I
have won!&nbsp; Now will I mount my white horse, and pursue after
Satan, and demolish his kingdom, and send him back to the land of
darkness in everlasting chains, and all his allies shall be
exiles with him for ever.&nbsp; My own arm, which has gained the
victory on Calvary, and brought salvation to all my people from
the sepulchre, is still strong enough to wield the golden sceptre
of love, and break my foes on the field of Armageddon.&nbsp; I
will destroy the works of the devil, and demolish all his hosts;
I will dash them in pieces like a potter&rsquo;s vessel.&nbsp;
For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my
redeemed is come.&nbsp; My compassion is stirred for the captives
of sin and death; my fury is kindled against the tyrants that
oppress them.&nbsp; It is time for me to open the prisons, and
break off the fetters.&nbsp; I must gather my people to
myself.&nbsp; I must seek that which was lost, and bring again
that which was driven away.&nbsp; I must bind up that which was
broken, and strengthen that which was weak; but I will destroy
the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment; I will
tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and bring
down their strength to the earth, and stain all my raiment with
their blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us flee from the wrath to come!&nbsp; Behold, the sun is
risen high on the day of vengeance!&nbsp; Let us not be found
among the enemies of Messiah, lest we fall a sacrifice to his
righteous indignation on the field of Armageddon!&nbsp; Let us
escape for our lives, for the fire-storm of his anger will burn
to the lowest hell!&nbsp; Let us pray for grace to lay hold on
the salvation of his redeemed!&nbsp; It is a free, full, perfect,
glorious, and eternal salvation.&nbsp; Return, ye ransomed exiles
from happiness, return to your forfeited inheritance!&nbsp; Now
is the year of jubilee.&nbsp; Come to Jesus, that your debts may
be cancelled, your sins forgiven, and your persons
justified!&nbsp; Come, for the Conqueror of your foes is on the
throne!&nbsp; Come, for the trumpets of mercy are sounding!&nbsp;
Come, for all things are now ready!</p>

THE SMITTEN ROCK.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>For they drank of that spiritual rock
that followed them</i>, <i>and that rock was
Christ</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. x. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter the apostle
solemnly cautions his brethren against apostasy, and consequent
shipwreck of their spiritual privileges.&nbsp; His admonitions
are educed from important events in the history of the journey of
the Israelites from Egypt to the land of Canaan.&nbsp; He speaks
of the march of the twelve tribes out of the scene of their
bondage, under the uplifted banner of God; of their baptism unto
Moses in the cloud and in the sea, when Jehovah gloriously
displayed his power in preserving their lives between the watery
ramparts which shut them in like the solid walls of the
sepulchre, while the cloud rested upon them through the deep
night, like the marble covering of the tomb; of their safe
emerging on the other side of the flood, a type of the
resurrection, leaving Pharaoh and his host to sleep in the waters
till the morning of the last day, when they shall rise without
their chariots and their horses; of their miraculous supply in
the wilderness, with bread from heaven, and water from the
smitten rock, which he calls spiritual meat and spiritual drink,
because of their typical reference to the sacrificial death of
Christ, which is the spiritual life of the world; and of their
subsequent ingratitude and forgetfulness of God, notwithstanding
these great deliverances and mercies, their murmurings,
idolatries, fornications, and tempting of Christ, for which they
were destroyed by the plague, slain by fiery serpents, smitten by
the angel of the Lord, and fell to the number of three and twenty
thousand in one day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now all these things,&rdquo; he
adds, &ldquo;happened unto them for ensamples, and are written
for our admonition, <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>upon whom the ends of the world are
come; wherefore, let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed
lest he fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus he opens the graves of ancient
sinners, and brings before his brethren the carcasses of those
&ldquo;who fell in the wilderness;&rdquo; brings them into our
solemn assemblies, and hangs them up over the pulpit, the
baptistery, and the communion-table, terrible warnings against
departing from the living God; even as the censers of Korah,
Dathan and Abiram were beaten up, and made a covering for the
altar, for a perpetual sign and memorial to Israel, to keep them
from the sin of those men, that they might not share their
fate.</p>
<p>In speaking of the smitten rock, which the apostle authorizes
us to regard as a type of Christ, we shall
consider:&mdash;<i>First</i>, Its smiting by Moses; and
<i>Secondly</i>, The consequent flowing of the waters.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The smitten rock was a type of Christ.&nbsp; Messiah
is the &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; to his church.&nbsp; He is the
foundation of her hope, sure and steadfast, and her protection in
times of danger and of dread.&nbsp; The armor and the prowess of
Egypt constituted no rock like this rock.&nbsp; Edom, and Moab,
and Philistia, and the seven nations of Canaan, had their gods
and their heroes; but their rock was not able to shelter them
from the wrath of Jehovah, when it came upon them like a tempest
of hail.&nbsp; The gods that made not the heavens and the earth
are far off in the day of trouble; but the God of Israel is
&ldquo;nigh at hand,&rdquo; and his arm is strong to
deliver.&nbsp; He is the rock that stood firm and immovable, for
the defence of his people, amid the ragings of the Red Sea.&nbsp;
Messiah is the man, who is predicted as &ldquo;a hiding-place
from the wind, and a covert from the tempest, and the shadow of a
great rock in a weary land.&rdquo;&nbsp; He can shield, not only
from the scorching sun and the scathing simoom of the desert; but
also from the fiery torments of remorse, and the ruinous
judgments of heaven.&nbsp; Our Lord is a rock, also, on account
of the blessings which flow from him, for the refreshment of his
Israel; as &ldquo;the droppings of honey from the rock;&rdquo; as
&ldquo;springs of water in a dry place;&rdquo; as &ldquo;living
streams in the desert,&rdquo; and &ldquo;rivers from the
mountains of Lebanon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two accounts of the smiting of the rock; one in the
seventeenth chapter of Exodus, and the other in the twentieth
chapter of Numbers.&nbsp; From a comparison of these two
accounts, it appears that the rock was smitten at two different
times; the first, as is supposed, about a year after the egress
from Egypt, and the <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>other about a year before the
entrance into Canaan; making an intervening period of about
thirty-eight years.&nbsp; The war with Amalek succeeded the
first; the embassy to Edom followed the second.&nbsp; At the
first, Miriam was alive; just before the second is the record of
her death.</p>
<p>It seems that the people murmured bitterly against Moses,
spoke of their superior fare in Egypt, and accused him of
bringing them out into the wilderness to kill them with
thirst.&nbsp; This is ever the spirit of backsliding.&nbsp; Those
who are under its influence are apt to complain of the burdens
imposed upon them by their religion, and the injuries occasioned
to them by their brethren; and to speak uncharitably of their
spiritual leaders, instead of crying to God for help.&nbsp; To
ask, &ldquo;Is the Lord among us?&rdquo; when his word and his
works, indicating either his pleasure or his displeasure, testify
that he is, is tempting God, with a dreadful presumption.</p>
<p>It does not appear that Moses sinned the first time he smote
the rock; but the second time, the servant of God was evidently
off his guard, and the meekest of men &ldquo;spake unadvisedly
with his lips;&rdquo; on account of which, both he and Aaron were
shut out of the promised land.&nbsp; His sin consisted in
entering into a quarrel with the people, instead of asking God
for water to quench their thirst.&nbsp; It appears that their
chidings had provoked him to anger, and he had lost the spirit of
sympathy for their sufferings, and his hard feelings stood like a
thick wall between him and the miracle which God was about to
work for his own glory and his people&rsquo;s relief.&nbsp;
Neither did he as God commanded him; for instead of simply
speaking to the rock, as he was bidden, he smote it twice, with
evident agitation of mind; and at the same time, bitterly
reproached the people with their rebellion.</p>
<p>Every minister of the gospel is a &ldquo;drawer of
water,&rdquo; to his congregation, from the &ldquo;Spiritual
Rock&rdquo; which follows the church.&nbsp; He must be clothed
with meekness from Heaven, or the provocations of the people will
be apt to embitter his spirit.&nbsp; God would have us minister
mercy, in the spirit of his own mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;The servant
of God must not strive, but be gentle toward all men; in meekness
instructing those that oppose themselves, if, peradventure, God
would grant them repentance unto the acknowledging of the truth:
and that they might recover themselves out of the snare of the
devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>The
smiting of the rock was intended to open it, that the water might
flow.&nbsp; This prefigured the smiting of Christ, &ldquo;the
Rock of Ages,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Shepherd of the
sheep.&rdquo;&nbsp; The shedding of the blood of lambs, and
goats, and calves, and bullocks, for the space of four thousand
years, faintly shadowed forth the sacrificial passion of our
blessed Lord.&nbsp; Their groans and struggles under the
slaughtering knife; the sound of the blood, falling into the
golden basins, and poured into the flames upon the altar; the
noise occasioned in cutting up the victim, and piling the pieces
upon the fire and the smoke and vapor ascending from the
consuming sacrifice to heaven; all, all, in their own way,
foreshadowed the necessity of mangling the body and shedding the
blood of Messiah, that pardoning mercy might have an open way to
flow to sinners, like the water from the smitten rock; and the
agonies of those slaughtered victims were an imperfect type of
the agonies of the soul of Jesus, in the garden and on the
cross.</p>
<p>The smiting of a flinty rock, for the purpose of obtaining
water, was a scheme of the Divine Mind, whose ways are higher
than our ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts.&nbsp; It was
certainly the last place to which Moses would have gone for
water; and he might have expected the stroke to elicit sparks of
fire, rather than cool refreshing streams.&nbsp; What eye had not
seen and ear had not heard, either of men or of angels&mdash;what
had not entered into the heart of any created being to conceive,
terrestrial or celestials&mdash;was, that the smiting of the
Shepherd should save the sheep; that the condemnation of the just
should bring the unjust to God; that the making of Messiah a
curse should secure infinite blessings to mankind; that the
poverty of Jesus should enrich us, and his death raise us to life
eternal.&nbsp; Consuming flames of Divine indignation might have
been expected to flash upon the guilty world from every wound of
the thorns, the nails and the spear, in the sacred person of
Emmanuel; but, to the astonishment of men and angels, a tide of
love and mercy ran freely from every bleeding vein, to wash away
the guilt and pollution of human crimes, according to the
determinate counsel and immutable promise of our God.</p>
<p>The rock must be smitten by a rod.&nbsp; Had Moses been left
to choose his own instrument, he would probably have taken a
hammer, or perhaps a lever; but God commands him to take the
rod.&nbsp; The rock would not have yielded water to any other
instrument <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>than the rod that smote the waters of Egypt, and turned
them into blood.&nbsp; This rod was an emblem of the sovereignty
of God over Israel, and is therefore called &ldquo;the rod of
God, which the Lord gave unto Moses&rdquo;&mdash;as his deputy
governor&mdash;&ldquo;to lead Israel, and to work miracles before
their eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was also a symbol of the royal law of
Heaven; which, prior to the fall, was a rod of life; but
afterward became a rod of iron, to break in pieces the
offender&mdash;an angry serpent, to sting the transgressor with
dreadful torments; and finally, when Christ endured the curse,
and honored the violated mandate, by his death upon the tree, it
was transformed again into a guiding and correcting rod.&nbsp; As
the rock would have yielded water under no other stroke than that
of &ldquo;the rod of God,&rdquo; so the sufferings of Christ
would have been ineffectual, had they not happened under the law
of the Father, and according to the counsel of Infinite
Wisdom.&nbsp; When Isaac was about to be offered up on mount
Moriah, the wood, the fire, and the knife, must all come from his
father&rsquo;s house, and the dreadful deed must be done by his
father&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; So Jesus must die in no ordinary or
accidental way.&nbsp; He must not suffer himself to be slain by
the sword of Herod, nor cast over the brow of the hill by the
people.&nbsp; He must receive the mortal cup from no other hand
than that of the Father.&nbsp; He must die the appointed death;
at the appointed time; in the appointed place, without the camp;
and in the appointed manner, by hanging on a tree.&nbsp; The
wreath of thorns, the scarlet robe, the nails, the cross, the
spear, and even the vinegar offered him in his agony, were all
according to his Father&rsquo;s counsel.&nbsp; He knew the
necessity, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Thy will be done!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Shepherd of Israel would bow under no other stroke than that
of the Lord of Hosts.&nbsp; A cradle, a cross, and a grave, all
of his Father&rsquo;s appointing, must Jesus have, in order to
open a fountain of living water to the world.</p>
<p>The rock must be smitten in a public manner, in the sight of
the sun, and before all the elders of Israel, that God might be
sanctified in the eyes of his people.&nbsp; This was intended to
foreshadow the publicity of the death of Christ, which took place
during one of the great public festivals of the Jews, in the
presence of nearly the whole nation, and on the hill Calvary; and
to denote the proclamation of Christ crucified throughout the
world, as the true propitiation and object of faith, to be looked
upon by Jews and Gentiles, <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>to the softening of the heart, and
the flowing of repentant tears, according to the
prophecy&mdash;&ldquo;They shall look on him whom they have
pierced, and mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only
son.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Spirit of grace directs the eyes of men to
the cross, upon which the prophet Isaiah, with transcendent
sublimity of language, describes the Saviour as passing from
Calvary to the grave, from the grave to the empyrean, and thence
back again to earth, crying&mdash;&ldquo;Look unto me, and be ye
saved, all ye ends of the earth; for I am God, and beside me
there is no Savior!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rock must be smitten in the presence of God.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold, I will stand before thee there on the rock in
Horeb.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ex. xvii. 6.)&nbsp; He stood upon the rock
in Horeb, though invisible, in the glory of his loving-kindness
and his power, to guide the hand of his servant Moses, and open a
source of timely succor to his perishing people.&nbsp; But when
the rod of the law smote the Rock of our salvation, when the
curse fell upon the sinner&rsquo;s Substitute and Surety, then
God stood forth before the world upon the rock of Calvary, amid
the darkened heavens, the trembling earth, and the opening
sepulchres, as if all the machinery of nature had been suddenly
disordered and disorganized&mdash;stood forth in the plenitude of
his power, his wisdom, his justice, his mercy, and his truth, to
prosper the work of man&rsquo;s redemption, and open a channel
through which the river of life might flow out to a famishing
race.&nbsp; On Calvary still he stands, with the cup of salvation
in his hand, and streams of living water rolling at his feet, and
cries&mdash;&ldquo;Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
waters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the command of God, the rock was to be smitten
but once.&nbsp; Once smitten, it needed only to be spoken to;
and, though it was more than thirty years afterward, it would
yield forth its water.&nbsp; But Moses, provoked to anger by the
murmurings and complainings of the people, transcended the Divine
injunction, and though he had once smitten the rock, smote it
again; yea, when he should have spoken to it only, smote it twice
with his rod.&nbsp; This was his sin, for which God would not
permit him to enter the promised land.&nbsp; Christ has been once
smitten, and wo to those who smite him again!&nbsp; He has once
offered himself a sacrifice, and once entered into the holy
place, having finished his work of atonement, and made an end of
sin, and superseded the sacrifices of the law.&nbsp; Henceforth,
ye Jews, relinquish your burnt-offerings, your <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>meat-offerings, your drink-offerings, your
peace-offerings; and trust no longer in beasts, and birds, and
flour, and oil; but in &ldquo;the Lamb of God, that taketh away
the sin of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Crucify him afresh no more, O
ye backsliders; for &ldquo;there remaineth no other sacrifice for
sin!&rdquo;&nbsp; Smite him not again, lest he swear unto you in
his wrath, as unto Moses, that ye shall not enter into his
rest!</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Having spoken of the smiting, let us now look at the
result, the flowing of the waters; a timely mercy to &ldquo;the
many thousands of Israel,&rdquo; on the point of perishing in the
desert; shadowing forth a far greater mercy, the flowing of
living waters from the &ldquo;spiritual rock,&rdquo; which is
Christ.</p>
<p>In the death of our Redeemer, we see three infinite depths
moved for the relief of human misery; the love of the Father, the
merit of the Son, and the energy of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; These
are the depths of wonder whence arise the rivers of
salvation.</p>
<p>The waters flowed in the presence of the whole assembly.&nbsp;
The agent was invisible, but his work was manifest. * * * * * * *
* * *</p>
<p>The water flowed in great abundance, filling the whole camp,
and supplying all the people.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the immense
number, and the greatness of their thirst, there was enough for
each and for all.&nbsp; The streams ran in every direction to
meet the sufferers, and their rippling murmur seemed to
say&mdash;&ldquo;Open thy mouth, and I will fill it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Look to the cross!&nbsp; See there the gracious fountain opened,
and streams of pardoning and purifying mercy flowing down the
rock of Calvary, sweeping over the mount of Olives, and cleaving
it asunder, to make a channel for the living waters to go out
over the whole world, that God may be glorified among the
Gentiles, and all the ends of the earth may see his
salvation!</p>
<p>The water flowed from the rock, not pumped by human labor, but
drawn by the hand of God.&nbsp; It was the same power, that
opened the springs of mercy upon the cross.&nbsp; It was the
wisdom of God that devised the plan, and the mercy of God that
furnished the victim.&nbsp; His was the truth and love that gave
the promise by the prophet&mdash;&ldquo;In that day there shall
be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and uncleanness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His was the unchanging faithfulness that fulfilled it in his
Son&mdash;&ldquo;Not by works of righteousness which we have
done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
regeneration, <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us
abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
salvation is wholly of God; and we have no other agency in the
matter, than the mere acceptance of his proffered grace.</p>
<p>The water flowed in twelve different channels; and, according
to Dr. Pococke, of Scotland, who visited the place, the deep
traces in the rock are visible to this day.&nbsp; But the twelve
streams, one for each tribe, all issued from the same fountain,
in the same rock.&nbsp; So the great salvation flowed out through
the ministry of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and went abroad
over all the earth.&nbsp; But the fountain is one.&nbsp; All the
apostles preached the same Savior, and pointed to the same
cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither is there salvation in any other, for
there is no other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we
must be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; We must come to this spring, or
perish.</p>
<p>The flowing of the waters was irresistible by human
power.&nbsp; Who can close the fountain which God hath
opened?&nbsp; Can Edom, or Moab, or Sihon, or Og, dam up the
current which Jehovah hath drawn from the rock?&nbsp; Can
Caiaphas, and all the Jews, aided by the Prince of this
world&mdash;can all the powers of earth and hell
combined&mdash;arrest the work of redemption, and dry up the
fountain of mercy that Christ is opening on Calvary?&nbsp; As
soon might they dry up the Atlantic, and stop the revolutions of
the globe.&nbsp; It is written, and must be fulfilled.&nbsp;
Christ must suffer, and enter into his glory&mdash;must be lifted
up, and draw all men unto him&mdash;and repentance and remission
of sins must be preached in his name among all nations, beginning
at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The water flowing from the rock was like a river of life to
the children of Israel.&nbsp; Who can describe the distress
throughout the camp; and the appearance of the people, when they
were invited to approach a flinty rock, instead of a fountain or
a stream, to quench their thirst?&nbsp; What angry countenances
were there, what bitter censures, and ungrateful murmurings, as
Moses went up to the rock, with nothing in his hand but a
rod!&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is he going,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;with that dry stick?&nbsp; What is he going to do on that
rock?&nbsp; Does he mean to make fools of us all?&nbsp; Is it not
enough that he has brought us into this wilderness to die of
thirst?&nbsp; Will he mock us now by pretending to seek water in
these sands, or open fountains in the solid granite?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But see! he lifts the rod, he smites the rock; and lo, it bursts
into a fountain; and twelve <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>crystal streams roll down before the
people!&nbsp; Who can conceive the sudden transport?&nbsp; Hear
the shout of joy ringing through the camp, and rolling back in
tumultuous echoes from the crags and cliffs of Horeb!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Water! water!&nbsp; A miracle! a miracle!&nbsp; Glory to
the God of Israel!&nbsp; Glory to his servant Moses!&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was a resurrection day to Israel, the morning light bursting
upon the shadow of death.&nbsp; New life and joy are seen
throughout the camp.&nbsp; The maidens are running, with cups and
pitchers, to the rock.&nbsp; They fill and drink; then fill
again, and haste away to their respective tents, with water for
the sick, the aged, and the little ones, joyfully
exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Drink, father!&nbsp; Drink, mother!&nbsp;
Drink, children!&nbsp; Drink, all of you!&nbsp; Drink
abundantly!&nbsp; Plenty of water now!&nbsp; Rivers flowing from
the rock!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the oxen are coming, the asses, the
camels, the sheep, and the goats&mdash;coming in crowds to quench
their thirst, and plunging into the streams before them.&nbsp;
And the feathered tribes are coming, the turtle-dove, the pigeon,
the swallow, the sparrow, the robin, and the wren; while the
croaking raven and the fierce-eyed eagle, scenting the water from
afar, mingle with them around the rock.</p>
<p>Brethren, this is but a faint emblem of the joy of the church,
in drinking the waters that descend from Calvary, the streams
that gladden the city of our God.&nbsp; Go back to the day of
Pentecost for an instance.&nbsp; O what a revolution of thought,
and feeling, and character!&nbsp; What a change of countenance,
and conscience, and heart!&nbsp; Three thousand men, that morning
full of ignorance, and corruption, and guilt&mdash;idolaters,
sensualists, blasphemers, persecutors&mdash;before night were
perfectly transformed&mdash;the lions converted into
lambs&mdash;the hard heart melted, the dead conscience quickened,
and the whole man become a new creature in Christ Jesus!&nbsp;
They thirsted, they found the &ldquo;Spiritual rock,&rdquo;
tasted its living waters, and suddenly leaped into new life, like
Lazarus from the inanition of the grave!</p>
<p>This is the blessing which follows the church through all her
wanderings in the wilderness; accompanies her through the
scorching desert of affliction, and the valley of the shadow of
death; and when at last she shall come up out of great
tribulation, her garments shall be found washed and made white in
the blood of the Lamb; and the Lamb who is in the midst of the
throne shall lead her to everlasting fountains, and she shall
thirst no more!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span> was created in the image of
God.&nbsp; Knowledge and perfect holiness were impressed upon the
very nature and faculties of his soul.&nbsp; He had constant
access to his Maker, and enjoyed free communion with him, on the
ground of his spotless moral rectitude.&nbsp; But alas! the
glorious diadem is broken; the crown of righteousness is
fallen.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s purity is gone, and his happiness is
forfeited.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is none righteous; no, not
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All have sinned, and come short of the
glory of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the ruin is not hopeless.&nbsp;
What was lost in Adam, is restored in Christ.&nbsp; His blood
redeems us from bondage, and his gospel gives us back the
forfeited inheritance.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;For if, through the
offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the
gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded
unto many.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us consider;&mdash;<i>First</i>, The
corruption and condemnation of man; and <i>Secondly</i>, His
gracious restoration to the favor of his offended God.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; To find the cause of man&rsquo;s corruption and
condemnation, we must go back to Eden.&nbsp; The eating of the
&ldquo;forbidden tree&rdquo; was &ldquo;the offence of
one,&rdquo; in consequence of which &ldquo;many are
dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; the act of
&ldquo;disobedience,&rdquo; which &ldquo;brought death into the
world, and all our wo.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the greatest
ingratitude to the Divine bounty, and the boldest rebellion
against the Divine sovereignty.&nbsp; The royalty of God was
contemned; the riches of his goodness slighted; and his most
desperate enemy preferred before him, as if he were a wiser
counselor than Infinite <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Wisdom.&nbsp; Thus man joined in
league with hell, against Heaven; with demons of the bottomless
pit, against the Almighty Maker and Benefactor; robbing God of
the obedience due to his command, and the glory due to his name;
worshipping the creature, instead of the Creator; and opening the
door to pride, unbelief, enmity, and all wicked and abominable
passions.&nbsp; How is the &ldquo;noble vine,&rdquo; which was
planted &ldquo;wholly a right seed,&rdquo; &ldquo;turned into the
degenerate plant of a strange vine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can look for pure water from such a fountain?&nbsp;
&ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
the faculties of the soul are corrupted by sin; the understanding
dark; the will perverse; the affections carnal; the conscience
full of shame, remorse, confusion, and mortal fear.&nbsp; Man is
a hard-hearted and stiff-necked sinner; loving darkness rather
than light, because his deeds are evil; eating sin like bread,
and drinking iniquity like water; holding fast deceit, and
refusing to let it go.&nbsp; His heart is desperately wicked;
full of pride, vanity, hypocrisy, covetousness, hatred of truth,
and hostility to all that is good.</p>
<p>This depravity is universal.&nbsp; Among the natural children
of Adam, there is no exemption from the original taint.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The whole world lieth in wickedness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness
is as filthy rags.&rdquo;&nbsp; The corruption may vary in the
degrees of development, in different persons; but the elements
are in all, and their nature is everywhere the same; the same in
the blooming youth, and the withered sire; in the haughty prince,
and the humble peasant; in the strongest giant, and the feeblest
invalid.&nbsp; The enemy has &ldquo;come in like a
flood.&rdquo;&nbsp; The deluge of sin has swept the world.&nbsp;
From the highest to the lowest, there is no health or moral
soundness.&nbsp; From the crown of the head to the soles of the
feet, there is nothing but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying
sores.&nbsp; The laws, and their violation, and the punishments
everywhere invented for the suppression of vice, prove the
universality of the evil.&nbsp; The bloody sacrifices, and
various purifications, of the pagans, show the handwriting of
remorse upon their consciences; proclaim their sense of guilt,
and their dread of punishment.&nbsp; None of them is free from
the fear which hath torment, whatever their efforts to overcome
it, and however great their boldness in the service of sin and
Satan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mene! Tekel!&rdquo; is written on every human
heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wanting! <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>wanting!&rdquo; is inscribed on
heathen fanes and altars; on the laws, customs, and institutions
of every nation; and on the universal consciousness of
mankind.</p>
<p>This inward corruption manifests itself in outward
actions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The tree is known by its
fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the smoke and sparks of the chimney show
that there is fire within; so all the &ldquo;filthy
conversation&rdquo; of men, and all &ldquo;the unfruitful works
of darkness&rdquo; in which they delight, evidently indicate the
pollution of the source whence they proceed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out of
the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
sinner&rsquo;s speech betrayeth him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Evil
speaking&rdquo; proceeds from malice and envy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Foolish talking and jesting,&rdquo; are evidence of impure
and trifling thoughts.&nbsp; The mouth full of cursing and
bitterness, the throat an open sepulchre, the poison of asps
under the tongue, the feet swift to shed blood, destruction and
misery in their paths, and the way of peace unknown to them, are
the clearest and amplest demonstration that men &ldquo;have gone
out of the way,&rdquo; &ldquo;have together become
unprofitable.&rdquo;&nbsp; We see the bitter fruit of the same
corruption in robbery, adultery, gluttony, drunkenness,
extortion, intolerance, persecution, apostasy, and every evil
work&mdash;in all false religions; the Jew, obstinately adhering
to the carnal ceremonies of an abrogated law; the Mohammedan,
honoring an impostor, and receiving a lie for a revelation from
God; the Papist, worshipping images and relics, praying to
departed saints, seeking absolution from sinful men, and trusting
in the most absurd mummeries for salvation; the Pagan,
attributing divinity to the works of his own hands, adoring idols
of wood and stone, sacrificing to malignant demons, casting his
children into the fire or the flood as an offering to imaginary
deities, and changing the glory of the incorruptible God into the
likeness of the beast and the worm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For these things&rsquo; sake the wrath of God cometh
upon the children of disobedience.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are under
the sentence of the broken law; the malediction of Eternal
Justice.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the offence of one, judgment came upon
all men unto condemnation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that believeth
not is condemned already.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The wrath of God
abideth on him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cursed is every one that
continueth not in all things written in the book of the law, to
do them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wo unto the wicked; it shall be ill
with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They that plow iniquity, and sow
wickedness <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>shall reap the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon the
wicked the Lord shall rain fire, and snares, and a horrible
tempest; this shall be the portion of their cup.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;God is angry with the wicked every day; if he turn not, he
will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who shall describe the misery of fallen men!&nbsp; His days,
though few, are full of evil.&nbsp; Trouble and sorrow press him
forward to the tomb.&nbsp; All the world, except Noah and his
family, are drowning in the deluge.&nbsp; A storm of fire and
brimstone is fallen from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah.&nbsp;
The earth is opening her mouth to swallow up alive Korah, Dathan,
and Abiram.&nbsp; Wrath is coming upon &ldquo;the Beloved
City,&rdquo; even &ldquo;wrath unto the uttermost.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The tender and delicate mother is devouring her darling
infant.&nbsp; The sword of man is executing the vengeance of
God.&nbsp; The earth is emptying its inhabitants into the
bottomless pit.&nbsp; On every hand are &ldquo;confused noises,
and garments rolled in blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fire and sword fill
the land with consternation and dismay.&nbsp; Amid the universal
devastation, wild shrieks and despairing groans fill the
air.&nbsp; God of mercy! is thy ear heavy, that thou canst not
hear? or thy arm shortened, that thou canst not save?&nbsp; The
heavens above are brass, and the earth beneath is iron; for
Jehovah is pouring his indignation upon his adversaries, and he
will not pity or spare.</p>
<p>Verily, &ldquo;the misery of man is great upon
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Behold the wretched fallen creature!&nbsp; The
pestilence pursues him.&nbsp; The leprosy cleaves to him.&nbsp;
Consumption is wasting him.&nbsp; Inflammation is devouring his
vitals.&nbsp; Burning fever has seized upon the very springs of
life.&nbsp; The destroying angel has overtaken the sinner in his
sins.&nbsp; The hand of God is upon him.&nbsp; The fires of wrath
are kindling about him, drying up every well of comfort, and
scorching all his hopes to ashes.&nbsp; Conscience is chastising
him with scorpions.&nbsp; See how he writhes!&nbsp; Hear how he
shrieks for help!&nbsp; Mark what agony and terror are in his
soul, and on his brow!&nbsp; Death stares him in the face, and
shakes at him his iron spear.&nbsp; He trembles, he turns pale,
as a culprit at the bar, as a convict on the scaffold.&nbsp; He
is condemned already.&nbsp; Conscience has pronounced the
sentence.&nbsp; Anguish has taken hold upon him.&nbsp; Terrors
gather in battle-array about him.&nbsp; He looks back, and the
storms of Sinai pursue him; forward, and hell is moved to meet
him; above, and the heavens <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>are on fire; beneath, and the world
is burning.&nbsp; He listens, and the judgment trump is calling;
again, and the brazen chariots of vengeance are thundering from
afar; yet again, and the sentence penetrates his soul with
anguish unspeakable&mdash;&ldquo;Depart! ye accursed into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, &ldquo;by one man, sin entered into the world, and death
by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
sinned.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are &ldquo;dead in trespasses and
sins;&rdquo; spiritually dead, and legally dead; dead by the
mortal power of sin, and dead by the condemnatory sentence of the
law; and helpless as sheep to the slaughter, they are driven
fiercely on by the ministers of wrath to the all-devouring grave,
and the lake of fire!</p>
<p>But is there no mercy?&nbsp; Is there no means of
salvation?&nbsp; Hark! amidst all this prelude of wrath and ruin,
comes a still small voice, saying: &ldquo;much more the grace of
God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ,
hath abounded unto many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; This brings us to our second topic, man&rsquo;s
gracious recovery to the favor of his offended God.</p>
<p>I know not how to represent to you this glorious work, better
than by the following figure.&nbsp; Suppose a vast graveyard,
surrounded by a lofty wall, with only one entrance, which is by a
massive iron gate, and that is fast bolted.&nbsp; Within are
thousands and millions of human beings, of all ages and classes,
by one epidemic disease bending to the grave.&nbsp; The graves
yawn to swallow them, and they must all perish.&nbsp; There is no
balm to relieve, no physician there.&nbsp; Such is the condition
of man as a sinner.&nbsp; All have sinned; and it is written,
&ldquo;The soul that sinneth shall die.&rdquo;&nbsp; But while
the unhappy race lay in that dismal prison, Mercy came and stood
at the gate, and wept over the melancholy scene,
exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;O that I might enter!&nbsp; I would bind
up their wounds; I would relieve their sorrows; I would save
their souls!&rdquo;&nbsp; An embassy of angels, commissioned from
the court of Heaven to some other world, paused at the sight, and
Heaven forgave that pause.&nbsp; Seeing Mercy standing there,
they cried:&mdash;&ldquo;Mercy! canst thou not enter?&nbsp; Canst
thou look upon that scene and not pity?&nbsp; Canst thou pity,
and not relieve?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mercy replied: &ldquo;I can
see!&rdquo; and in her tears she added, &ldquo;I can pity, but I
cannot relieve!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why canst thou not
enter?&rdquo; inquired the heavenly host.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
said <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Mercy, &ldquo;Justice has barred the gate against me,
and I must not&mdash;cannot unbar it!&rdquo;&nbsp; At this
moment, Justice himself appeared, as if to watch the gate.&nbsp;
The angels asked, &ldquo;Why wilt thou not suffer Mercy to
enter?&rdquo;&nbsp; He sternly replied: &ldquo;The law is broken,
and it must be honored!&nbsp; Die they or Justice
must!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then appeared a form among the angelic band
like unto the Son of God.&nbsp; Addressing himself to Justice, he
said: &ldquo;What are thy demands?&rdquo;&nbsp; Justice replied:
&ldquo;My demands are rigid; I must have ignominy for their
honor, sickness for their health, death for their life.&nbsp;
Without the shedding of blood there is no remission!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; said the Son of God, &ldquo;I accept thy
terms!&nbsp; On me be this wrong!&nbsp; Let Mercy enter, and stay
the carnival of death!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What pledge dost thou
give for the performance of these conditions?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;My word; my oath!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When wilt thou
perform them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Four thousand years hence, on
the hill of Calvary, without the walls of Jerusalem!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The bond was prepared, and signed and sealed in the presence of
attendant angels.&nbsp; Justice was satisfied, the gate was
opened, and Mercy entered, preaching salvation in the name of
Jesus.&nbsp; The bond was committed to patriarchs and
prophets.&nbsp; A long series of rites and ceremonies, sacrifices
and oblations, was instituted to perpetuate the memory of that
solemn deed.&nbsp; At the close of the four-thousandth year, when
Daniel&rsquo;s &ldquo;seventy weeks&rdquo; were accomplished,
Justice and Mercy appeared on the hill of Calvary.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; said Justice, &ldquo;is the Son of
God?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold him,&rdquo; answered Mercy,
&ldquo;at the foot of the hill!&rdquo;&nbsp; And there he came,
bearing his own cross, and followed by his weeping church.&nbsp;
Mercy retired, and stood aloof from the scene.&nbsp; Jesus
ascended the hill, like a lamb for the sacrifice.&nbsp; Justice
presented the dreadful bond, saying, &ldquo;This is the day on
which this article must be cancelled.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Redeemer
took it.&nbsp; What did he do with it?&nbsp; Tear it in pieces,
and scatter it to the winds?&nbsp; No! he nailed it to his cross,
crying, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Victim ascended
the altar.&nbsp; Justice called on holy fire to come down and
consume the sacrifice.&nbsp; Holy fire replied: &ldquo;I
come!&nbsp; I will consume the sacrifice, and then I will burn up
the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; It fell upon the Son of God, and rapidly
consumed his humanity; but when it touched his Deity, it
expired.&nbsp; Then was there darkness over the whole land, and
an earthquake shook the mountain; but the heavenly host broke
forth <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>in
rapturous song&mdash;&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest! on earth
peace! good will to man!&rdquo; <a name="citation114"></a><a
href="#footnote114" class="citation">[114]</a></p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Thus
grace has abounded, and the free gift has come upon all, and the
gospel has gone forth proclaiming redemption to every <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>creature.&nbsp; &ldquo;By grace ye are saved, through
faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of
works, least any man should boast.&rdquo;&nbsp; By grace ye are
loved, redeemed and justified.&nbsp; By grace ye are called,
converted, reconciled and sanctified.&nbsp; Salvation is wholly
of grace.&nbsp; The plan, the process, the consummation, are all
of grace.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Grace all the work shall crown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through everlasting days;<br />
It lays in heaven the topmost stone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And well deserves the praise!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where sin abounded, grace hath much more
abounded.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Through the offence of one, many
were dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as men multiplied, <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>the offence
abounded.&nbsp; The waters deluged the world, but could not wash
away the dreadful stain.&nbsp; The fire fell from heaven, but
could not burn out the accursed plague.&nbsp; The earth opened
her mouth, but could not swallow up the monster sin.&nbsp; The
law thundered forth its threat from the thick darkness on Sinai;
but could not restrain, by all its terrors, the children of
disobedience.&nbsp; Still the offence abounded, and multiplied as
the sands on the sea-shore.&nbsp; It waxed bold, and pitched its
tents on Calvary, and nailed the Lawgiver to a tree.&nbsp; But in
that conflict sin received its mortal wound.&nbsp; The Victim was
the Victor.&nbsp; He fell, but in his fall he crushed the
foe.&nbsp; He died unto sin, but sin and death were crucified
upon his cross.&nbsp; Where sin abounded to condemn, grace hath
much more abounded to justify.&nbsp; Where sin abounded to
corrupt, grace hath much more abounded to purify.&nbsp; Where sin
abounded to harden, grace hath much more abounded to soften and
subdue.&nbsp; Where sin abounded to imprison men, grace hath much
more abounded to proclaim liberty to the captives.&nbsp; Where
sin abounded to break the law and dishonor the Lawgiver, grace
hath much more abounded to repair the breach and efface the
stain.&nbsp; Where sin abounded to consume the soul as with
unquenchable fire and a gnawing worm, grace hath much more
abounded to extinguish the flame and heal the wound.&nbsp; Grace
hath abounded!&nbsp; It hath established its throne on the merit
of the Redeemer&rsquo;s sufferings.&nbsp; It hath put on the
crown, and laid hold of the golden scepter, and spoiled the
dominion of the prince of darkness, and the gates of the great
cemetery are thrown open, and there is the beating of a new
life-pulse throughout its wretched population, and Immortality is
walking among the tombs!</p>
<p>This abounding grace is manifested in the gift of Jesus
Christ, by whose mediation our reconciliation and salvation are
effected.&nbsp; With him, believers are dead unto sin, and alive
unto God.&nbsp; Our sins were slain at his cross, and buried in
his tomb.&nbsp; His resurrection hath opened our graves, and
given us an assurance of immortality.&nbsp; &ldquo;God commendeth
his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ
died for us; much more, then, being now justified by his blood,
we shall be saved from wrath through him; for if, when we were
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much
more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;The carnal mind is enmity against God; it is not
subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Glory to God, for the death of his Son, by which this enmity is
slain, and reconciliation is effected between the rebel and the
law!&nbsp; This was the unspeakable gift that saved us from ruin;
that wrestled with the storm, and turned it away from the devoted
head of the sinner.&nbsp; Had all the angels of God attempted to
stand between these two conflicting seas, they would have been
swept to the gulf of destruction.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blood of bulls
and goats, on Jewish altars slain,&rdquo; could not take away
sin, could not pacify the conscience.&nbsp; But Christ, the gift
of Divine Grace, &ldquo;Pascal Lamb by God appointed,&rdquo;
&ldquo;a sacrifice of nobler name and richer blood than
they,&rdquo; bore our sins, and carried our sorrows, and obtained
for us the boon of eternal redemption.&nbsp; He met the fury of
the tempest, and the floods went over his head; but his offering
was an offering of peace, calming the storms and the waves,
magnifying the law, glorifying its Author, and rescuing its
violator from wrath and rain.&nbsp; Justice hath laid down his
sword at the foot of the cross, and amity is restored between
heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Hither, O ye guilty! come and cast away your weapons of
rebellion!&nbsp; Come with your bad principles, and wicked
actions; your unbelief, and enmity, and pride; and throw them off
at the Redeemer&rsquo;s feet!&nbsp; God is here, waiting to be
gracious.&nbsp; He will receive you; he will cast all your sins
behind his back, into the depths of the sea; and they shall be
remembered against you no more for ever.&nbsp; By Heaven&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Unspeakable Gift,&rdquo; by Christ&rsquo;s invaluable
atonement, by the free and infinite grace of the Father and the
Son, we persuade you, we beseech you, we entreat you, &ldquo;be
ye reconciled to God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is by the work of the Holy Spirit within us, that we obtain
a personal interest in the work wrought on Calvary for us.&nbsp;
If our sins are cancelled, they are also crucified.&nbsp; If we
are reconciled in Christ, we fight against our God no more.&nbsp;
This is the fruit of faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;With the heart man
believeth unto righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; May the Lord inspire
in every one of us that saving principle!</p>
<p>But those who have been restored to the Divine favor may
sometimes be cast down and dejected.&nbsp; They have passed
through the sea, and sung praises on the shore of deliverance;
but there is yet between them and Canaan &ldquo;a waste howling
wilderness,&rdquo; a long <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>and weary pilgrimage, hostile
nations, fiery serpents, scarcity of food, and the river
Jordan.&nbsp; Fears within and fightings without, they may grow
discouraged, and yield to temptation, and murmur against God, and
desire to return to Egypt.&nbsp; But fear not, thou worm
Jacob!&nbsp; Reconciled by the death of Christ; much more, being
reconciled, thou shalt be saved by his life.&nbsp; His death was
the price of our redemption; his life insures liberty to the
believer.&nbsp; If by his death he brought you through the Red
Sea in the night, by his life he can lead you through the river
Jordan in the day.&nbsp; If by his death he delivered you from
the iron furnace in Egypt, by his life he can save you from all
the perils of the wilderness.&nbsp; If by his death he conquered
Pharaoh, the chief foe, by his life he can subdue Sihon, king of
the Amorites, and Og, the king of Bashan.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall
be saved by his life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because he liveth, we
shall live also.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be of good
cheer!&rdquo;&nbsp; The work is finished; the ransom is effected;
the kingdom of heaven is opened to all believers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lift up your heads and rejoice,&rdquo; &ldquo;ye prisoners
of hope!&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no debt unpaid, no devil
unconquered, no enemy within your own hearts that has not
received a mortal wound!&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks be unto God, who
giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ!&rdquo;</p>

ONE GOD AND ONE MEDIATOR.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>For there is one God</i>, <i>and one
Mediator between God and man</i>, <i>the man Christ
Jesus</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;1 Tim. ii. 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> apostle Paul urges the
propriety, and importance of praying for all men, in the several
conditions and relations of life, from a consideration of
God&rsquo;s merciful intentions toward all men, as exhibited in
the sufficiency of the gospel provision for their
salvation.&nbsp; But if any are saved, it must be through the
medium which God has ordained, and in the manner which God has
prescribed.&nbsp; Therefore the apostle adds: &ldquo;For there is
one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is one God,&rdquo; to whom
sinners have to be reconciled; &ldquo;and one Mediator,&rdquo;
through whom that reconciliation is to be effected.&nbsp; We have
a nearly parallel passage in another epistle: &ldquo;To us there
is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in
him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The unity of God, and the mediation of Christ,
are the two great topics of the text, to which we solicit your
attention.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; &ldquo;For there is one God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two
infinite beings cannot co-exist, unless they are one in essence
and in operation.&nbsp; The God of Israel pervades the universe
of matter, and fills the immensity of space.&nbsp; There is no
room for another God, possessing the same ubiquity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is one God and Father of all, who is above all, and
through all, and in you all.&rdquo;&nbsp; In him alone, all
things live, move, and have their being.</p>
<p>This doctrine is stamped on all the works of nature.&nbsp;
They all exhibit unity of design, and must have been contrived by
the same infinite wisdom, and executed by the same infinite
power.&nbsp; The <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>hand which created and arranged them is constantly seen
in their preservation.&nbsp; The Maker of all things continues to
uphold all things by the word of his power.&nbsp; The great
Architect still presides over the immense fabric which he has
reared.&nbsp; The universe, from age to age, is governed by the
same unvarying laws.&nbsp; All things remain as they were from
the beginning.&nbsp; The earth, the air, and the sea, sustain the
same mutual relations, and answer the same important ends; and
the sun, the moon, and the stars, shine on for ever.&nbsp; The
same order and regularity everywhere prevail, as when the chorus
of the morning stars welcomed the new creation into being.&nbsp;
Nature proclaims aloud: &ldquo;There is one God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same doctrine is impressed upon the Bible.&nbsp; It is not
only the book of God, but evidently the book of &ldquo;one
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a series of Divine Revelations, reaching
from Eden to Calvary, and from Calvary onward to the end of the
world.&nbsp; It is a golden chain, passing through all time, and
uniting the two eternities; and all its links are similar, and
depend upon each other.&nbsp; Its several parts are perfectly
harmonious, proving them to have emanated from the same infinite
mind.&nbsp; Everywhere we find the same character of God and of
man; the same description of the law and of sin; the same way of
pardon, and holiness, and immortal life.&nbsp; The same Eternal
Spirit, that inspired the Historian of Creation, speaks in the
Apocalypse of St. John, and in all the intervenient books of the
Bible.&nbsp; It was the same Sun of Righteousness, that rose in
Eden, and set on Calvary; and thence rose again the third day, to
set no more for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world by wisdom knew not God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
heathen lost the doctrine of the unity of God; not because it was
difficult to preserve, but because they did not love the
character of God, &ldquo;did not like to retain God in their
knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pride of the carnal mind led them to
turn away from the light of heaven, to walk amid sparks of their
own kindling.&nbsp; They boasted of their wisdom; they boasted of
their philosophy.&nbsp; And what gained they by the
exchange?&nbsp; The most absurd and stupid notions of the Great
First Cause; almost total ignorance of his attributes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools; and
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made
with hands, like unto corruptible man, and to birds, and
four-footed beasts, and creeping things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shame to
philosophic Greece and Rome!</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>No
nation, having once lost the doctrine of the unity of God, ever
regained it by the light of nature.&nbsp; If the light of nature
is sufficient to preserve it in possession, it is not sufficient
to restore it lost.&nbsp; It is restored only by the
gospel.&nbsp; The gospel has restored it in India, in Otaheite,
and other heathen lands.&nbsp; It has done more; it has revealed
to the savage the only way of salvation; it has &ldquo;brought
life and immortality to light.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fly abroad, thou mighty gospel!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Win and conquer! never cease!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lift up thy voice with strength, and proclaim to Greece and
Rome, and to all the ends of the earth, as well as to the cities
of Judah, that the Son of Mary is the God of Israel, &ldquo;God
manifest in the flesh,&rdquo; &ldquo;God blessed
forever!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The man Christ Jesus&rdquo; is
&ldquo;the brightness of the Father&rsquo;s glory, and the
express image of His person, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of
the Godhead bodily;&rdquo; &ldquo;in whom also we have redemption
through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the
riches of his grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; But this leads us to our second topic: &ldquo;And
one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two doctrines, you perceive, are
intimately related to each other.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
God&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;One Mediator.&rdquo;&nbsp; As we have but
&ldquo;one God,&rdquo; we need but &ldquo;one
Mediator.&rdquo;&nbsp; As that Mediator is himself God, the merit
of his mediation is sufficient for the salvation of all them that
believe.</p>
<p>The office of a Mediator supposes two parties at variance,
between whom he interposes to produce a reconciliation.&nbsp; It
is thus &ldquo;between God and man.&rdquo;&nbsp; God gave man a
law, &ldquo;holy, and just, and good;&rdquo; man revolted, and
&ldquo;there is wrath.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reconciliation is impossible,
without the intervention of a mediator.&nbsp; Let us look at the
parties engaged in this dreadful controversy.</p>
<p>On one side we see Jehovah, possessed of infinite perfections,
and clothed with uncreated excellence and glory.&nbsp; He is
self-existent, independent and eternal.&nbsp; Omnipresence,
Omniscience, and Almightiness are his.&nbsp; He is great in
wisdom, full of goodness, slow to anger, and ready to
pardon.&nbsp; His love is ineffable, and &ldquo;his mercy
endureth for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is &ldquo;glorious in
holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
perfections are the pearls and diamonds in his crown.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With him also is terrible majesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Life and
joy are in his smile, but the angel of destruction waits upon his
frown.&nbsp; One beam of his love can raise thousands of men <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>to heaven:
one glance of his anger, sink myriads of angels to hell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He sitteth upon the circles of the earth, and the
inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All
nations before him are as nothing; they are counted less than
nothing and vanity.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He doeth according to his
will among the children of men, and ruleth the armies of
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At his wrath the earth shall tremble,
and the nations shall not be able to abide his
indignation.&rdquo;&nbsp; O what majesty and power belong unto
the Lord our God!</p>
<p>With this imperfect view, contrast the impotence and
insignificance of sinful man.&nbsp; What is he?&nbsp; A being of
yesterday, &ldquo;whose breath is in his nostrils,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;whose foundation is in the dust.&rdquo;&nbsp; A frail,
helpless, perishing thing; dependent upon God, the Creator, for
all his comforts, for life itself.&nbsp; What is man?&nbsp; A
fool; an alien from all good; an embodiment of all evil.&nbsp;
His understanding is dark; his will perverse; his affections
carnal.&nbsp; His &ldquo;throat is an open sepulchre;&rdquo;
swallowing up &ldquo;whatsoever things are true, pure, lovely, or
of good report;&rdquo; emitting a pestilential vapor, which
withers every green herb, and sweet flower, and delicious fruit,
of honor to God, and happiness to man.&nbsp; &ldquo;The poison of
asps is under his tongue;&rdquo; an inflaming poison, affecting
all the members, and &ldquo;setting on fire the whole course of
nature, and it is set on fire of hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;His
heart is fully set in him to do evil;&rdquo; &ldquo;deceitful
above all things, and desperately wicked.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is an
enemy to his Maker; a rebel against Jehovah; a blank&mdash;nay,
worse&mdash;a blot in God&rsquo;s creation; dead to every virtue,
dead to every thing but sin; lost to every gracious purpose of
his being; a withered branch, fit only to be plucked off, and
cast into the fire; stubble, ready for the burning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let him alone!&rdquo; said Reason.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cut him
down!&rdquo; cried Justice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hate the workers of
iniquity!&rdquo; added Holiness.&nbsp; &ldquo;He or I must
perish!&rdquo; exclaimed Truth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spare him!&nbsp;
Spare him!&nbsp; Spare him!&rdquo; pleaded weeping Mercy.&nbsp;
And Wisdom came forth, leading the Son of God, and said: &ldquo;I
have found a ransom!&nbsp; Behold the Mediator!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
all the attributes met and embraced at the manger, and kissed
each other at the cross!</p>
<p>It was man&rsquo;s place, as the offender, to seek a
reconciliation.&nbsp; God was under no obligation.&nbsp; But,
alas! man had neither the means nor the inclination.&nbsp; What
could be done?&nbsp; Hear, O ye heavens! and be astonished!&nbsp;
Listen, O earth! and wonder and adore!&nbsp; While man was far
from God, an enemy in his heart by <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>wicked works, rushing on in
determined hostility to his Maker&rsquo;s government, and there
was no sacrifice found for his sin, and no disposition in him to
seek a sacrifice, God sought within himself the adequate and only
means of pardon and peace.&nbsp; He found in his own bosom the
Lamb for the altar; exhibited him to Israel in the predictions
and promises of the Old Testament; and in the fulness of time,
sent him forth to expiate sin, by the offering of himself, once
for all.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us; and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the Only
Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself,
and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God provided a Mediator.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Did he fear that the
deserved ruin of the human race would dethrone eternal
Justice?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Eternal Justice would have been honored
as much in their destruction as in their salvation.&nbsp; The law
would have been as fully vindicated in the infliction of its
penalty upon the transgressor, as in the reparation of its breach
by a vicarious atonement.&nbsp; The glory of the Divine
government would have been untarnished, as when the rebel angels
were cast down from heaven, and locked up in everlasting
darkness.&nbsp; This wondrous provision was not the result of
necessity, but the prompting of Infinite Love.&nbsp; Divine Mercy
sought to remove the barrier interposed by Divine Justice.&nbsp;
The sinner cannot be pardoned, till his Great Substitute has met
the demands of the law.&nbsp; There must be a full satisfaction
and settlement of its claims, as the only ground on which the
rebel can be acquitted.</p>
<p>Love is the &ldquo;Alpha and Omega&rdquo; of redemption, the
love of God to man.&nbsp; Read it in the journey of the Mediator
from heaven to earth!&nbsp; Read it in his pilgrimage through the
land of sorrow!&nbsp; Behold him &ldquo;nailed to the shameful
tree!&rdquo;&nbsp; See the blood and water gushing from his
side!&nbsp; Hear the sound of the water-spouts, as the floods of
wrath rollover him!&nbsp; Then ask the reason.&nbsp; The answer
is: &ldquo;God is love.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is not willing
that any should perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed good in his sight
to save his rebel children, whatever it might cost him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
eternal life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Herein is love, not that we
loved God&rdquo;&mdash;no; we hated him; we were his sworn,
inveterate foes; &ldquo;but that he loved us&rdquo;&mdash;loved
us while we were yet enemies&mdash;<a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>loved us with an ineffable love;
&ldquo;and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our
sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wonderful must be the qualifications of such a Mediator.&nbsp;
He fills with his own merit the gap between two worlds.&nbsp; He
bows the heavens, and lifts up the earth to meet them.&nbsp; He
takes hold of God and man, and brings them together in
himself.&nbsp; He reconciles the rebel and the law, glorifies the
Father by humbling himself, and his cross becomes our life, and
his tomb the birthplace of our immortality.</p>
<p>England and Wales could not be united till the son of the king
of England was born in Wales, and became Prince of Wales.&nbsp;
The English regarded him as heir to the throne of England; while
the Welsh claimed him as their brother, a native of their own
country, born in the castle of Caernarvon.&nbsp; Behold
&ldquo;the well beloved&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the only begotten of
the Father,&rdquo; &ldquo;heir of all things,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord
of lords, and King of kings,&rdquo; born &ldquo;in Bethlehem of
Judea;&rdquo; &ldquo;the Son of God&mdash;the Son of man;&rdquo;
partaking of both natures, and representing both parties in the
great controversy.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;the Mighty God, and the
Everlasting Father;&rdquo; yet he is our near kinsman&mdash;bone
of our bone, and flesh of our flesh.&nbsp; In his person, heaven
and earth are joined; by his blood, God and man are
reconciled.&nbsp; Heaven is his throne, for God is his father;
earth is his principality, for it is the land of his
nativity.&nbsp; In him angels recognise their King, and men
behold their brother.</p>
<p>I gaze on the cross, and methinks I hear the victim say:
&ldquo;Look unto me, and be ye saved, all ye ends of the earth;
for I am God, and beside me there is none else.&nbsp; I opened a
way for my people of old, by dividing the waters, to the Canaan
of Promise; I am now preparing a path for believers, through the
red sea of my blood, to the inheritance in heaven.&nbsp; I gave
the law amid fire and smoke on Sinai, and thundered forth my
curse upon its violater; I am here on Calvary, to honor that
violated law, and remove that curse from its violater by taking
it upon myself.&nbsp; Behold my hands, my feet, my side!&nbsp;
This blood, O men! is your sacrifice.&nbsp; I will expiate your
sin by my sufferings.&nbsp; I will magnify the law, and make it
honorable.&nbsp; And though in your nature I hang on this tree
to-day, I will revive, and live for ever, to make intercession
for the transgressors, and save to the uttermost all that come
unto God by me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>The
mediatorial office of &ldquo;the man Christ Jesus&rdquo; consists
of two parts, sacrifice and intercession.&nbsp; They are equally
important, and mutually dependent.&nbsp; Without sacrifice, there
is no ground of intercession; without intercession, there is no
benefit in sacrifice.&nbsp; The former renders the latter
influential with God; the latter renders the former available to
man.&nbsp; The one removes the obstacles to reconciliation, the
other brings the adverse parties together.</p>
<p>The first part of the mediatorial office is sacrifice.&nbsp;
In order to understand this aright, we must have correct views of
God, of man, and of sin.&nbsp; We must consider God as the
lawgiver and governor of the universe, eternally hostile to all
iniquity, and determined to sustain his just
administration.&nbsp; We must consider man as a guilty and
polluted creature, a rebel in arms against his Maker, a prisoner
under sentence and deserving punishment.&nbsp; We must consider
sin as an inexcusable omission of duty, and a flagrant
transgression of the law, under circumstances of peculiar
aggravation.&nbsp; The debt must be paid, or the sinner must
perish.&nbsp; An atonement must be made, of merit equal to the
turpitude of our crimes.&nbsp; The stain which we have cast upon
the law, must be washed out by blood of infinite
preciousness.&nbsp; This is the work of our Mediator.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;gave himself a ransom for all.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made a
perfect satisfaction for our sins.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was wounded
for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities; the
chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we
are healed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not by blood of bulls and goats,
slain on Jewish altars, but by a nobler and costlier
sacrifice&mdash;the paschal &ldquo;Lamb of God,&rdquo; that
heaven and earth are reconciled&mdash;God and man united.</p>
<p>The second part of the mediatorial office is
intercession.&nbsp; It was through the High-priest, the typical
mediator, that God communicated with Israel, and Israel
communicated with God; it is through &ldquo;the man Christ
Jesus,&rdquo; the real Mediator, that God speaks to the world,
and receives the prayers of his people.&nbsp; Having &ldquo;borne
the sins of many,&rdquo; he &ldquo;maketh intercession for the
transgressors.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He hath entered into heaven
himself, there to appear in the presence of God for
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has gone into the holy of holies, with
&ldquo;the blood of sprinkling, which speaketh better things than
the blood of Abel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man sin, we have an
advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Through him we
both&rdquo;&mdash;that is, both Jews and
Gentiles&mdash;&ldquo;have access by one Spirit unto the <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; He holds in his hand the golden
censer, and offers much incense before the throne.&nbsp; It is
this that perfumes our prayers, and renders them acceptable to
God.&nbsp; He pleaded for his murderers when he hung upon the
cross, and now he pleads in heaven for those who crucify him
afresh.&nbsp; And what is the ground of his plea?&nbsp; Not the
merit of our works, but the merit of his own sufferings.&nbsp;
Not the infinitude of the Father&rsquo;s mercy, but the
sufficiency of his own sacrifice.&nbsp; This is the sure
foundation of a sinner&rsquo;s hope.&nbsp; If Satan suggests that
his crimes are too great to be forgiven, he may reply: &ldquo;The
man Christ Jesus&rdquo; is my advocate, the advocate of
&ldquo;the chief of sinners;</p>
<blockquote><p>And should I die with mercy sought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I his grace have tried,<br />
I sure should die&mdash;delightful thought!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where sinner never died!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One Mediator.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no choice.&nbsp;
You must accept of him, or remain unreconciled, and be cast into
hell.&nbsp; Israel found but one path through the Red Sea; the
church shall never find more than one way to the heavenly
Canaan.&nbsp; It is only by faith in the &ldquo;One
Mediator,&rdquo; that you can obtain the favor of the &ldquo;One
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is the elect and beloved of the Father, the
appointed medium of man&rsquo;s approach, the designated channel
of God&rsquo;s communication.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither is there
salvation in any other.&rdquo;&nbsp; No other has been
provided.&nbsp; No other is suited to our necessities.&nbsp; O
sinner! come through this &ldquo;new and living way!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Christ invites your confidence.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Venture on him; venture freely;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let no other trust intrude!<br />
None but Jesus, none but Jesus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can do helpless sinners good.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These glorious truths, we cannot read too often, or meditate
too much.&nbsp; They represent to us the great evil of sin, the
infinite mercy of God, the inflexible character of the law, and
the incalculable preciousness of the gospel.&nbsp; Such is the
Father&rsquo;s estimate of the Mediator, that he will be
reconciled to sinners only through his blood.&nbsp; He is well
pleased with his Son, and well pleased with all who seek him
through his Son, and nothing is more offensive to him than the
rejection of his Son.&nbsp; May these remarks preserve you from
despair under a sense of your guilt and wretchedness; drive <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>you from
all false refuges to the cross, with a penitent and grateful
heart; induce you to trust; not in your own strength, or wisdom,
or righteousness, but in the adorable name of Jesus; to live a
life of faith in him, of love towards him, and of patient waiting
for his mercy unto eternal salvation!</p>
<p>If you are already partakers of these blessings, how
transcendent is your privilege!&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye are come unto
mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem;
and to an innumerable company of angels; and to the spirits of
just men made perfect; and to the general assembly and church of
the first-born, which are written in heaven; and to God, the
judge of all; and to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant; and
to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that
of Abel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Follow the Captain of your salvation.&nbsp;
Cleave to him in the fire and the flood.&nbsp; Turn not aside to
the lying vanities of the world, lest you drink the cup of its
eternal sorrows.&nbsp; Remember that those who suffer with the
crucified shall reign with the glorified; that such as are
faithful unto death shall receive the crown of life.&nbsp; Be
careful to &ldquo;keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of
peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Endure unto the end, and ye shall be
saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead
our Lord Jesus, that Great Shepherd of the sheep, through the
blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good
work, to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing
in his sight, through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory for
ever and ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amen.</p>

THE LIVING REDEEMER.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh that my words were now written</i>!
<i>oh that they were printed in a book</i>! <i>that they were
graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever</i>!&nbsp;
<i>For I know that my Redeemer liveth</i>, <i>and that he shall
stand at the latter day upon the earth</i>: <i>and though after
my skin worms destroy this body</i>, <i>yet in my flesh shall I
see God</i>: <i>whom I shall see for myself</i>, <i>and mine eyes
shall behold</i>, <i>and not another</i>; <i>though my reins be
consumed within me</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Job xix. 23&ndash;27.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the common opinion of learned
divines, that Job was an ancient prince in some part of Arabia,
known in his day by the name of Uz.&nbsp; His three friends
also&mdash;&ldquo;Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and
Zophar the Naamathite&rdquo;&mdash;were neighboring
princes.&nbsp; In their visit of condolence, they were
accompanied by Elihu, who seems to have been a young man of
extraordinary intelligence and virtue.&nbsp; The occasion of this
visit was the apparent judgments of God upon the patriarch.&nbsp;
They held a long controversy with him, in which they insisted
that his unparalleled calamities and sufferings proved him the
chief of hypocrites.&nbsp; Job as strenuously maintained his
innocence and integrity, and argued that his providential
afflictions were intended only for the proof and the improvement
of his piety; and that when this purpose should be accomplished,
he would come forth as gold purified from the furnace.&nbsp; God,
answering out of the whirlwind, settled the dispute, deciding in
favor of his servant Job; his three friends were required to
offer sacrifice for their faults, and Job must pray for their
forgiveness.&nbsp; Then the wheel of fortune turned in his favor,
and he was restored to his former prosperity.</p>
<p>Job and his friends evidently had a clear understanding of the
evil of sin, the wickedness of hypocrisy, the importance of the
fear of God, and the doctrine of an allwise superintending
providence; <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>and knew how to approach Jehovah through sacrifice, in
anticipation of the promised Messiah.</p>
<p>We shall offer a few general remarks on Job&rsquo;s faith in a
living Redeemer, as expressed in our text.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Our minds are struck with wonder and pleasure, in
beholding the patriarchs and prophets of ancient times, moved by
the Spirit of God, searching diligently for the person and grace
of the Messiah; like miners, opening an entrance to a precious
treasure, which is to redeem them and their brethren from
bondage.</p>
<p>Job has no reference here to any temporal deliverer, nor to
any other than the Messiah himself.&nbsp; He evidently saw what
he needed, when he was speaking of the Daysman, the Umpire, one
that might argue and settle the case between him and his Maker,
one that might lay his hand alike on God and man.&nbsp; With the
eye of faith, he saw the Messiah, setting one foot on the
continent of eternity, and the other on the sea of human misery,
and lifting up his hand and saying&mdash;&ldquo;Time and eternity
are mine!&nbsp; I am God, and beside me there is no
Saviour!&rdquo;&nbsp; Elihu also speaks of the same person, under
the name of &ldquo;a messenger,&rdquo; &ldquo;an
interpreter,&rdquo; &ldquo;one of a thousand,&rdquo; that might
commune with both God and man, concerning atonement, and
justifying righteousness, and deliverance from the pit of eternal
destruction.</p>
<p>The promise of a Redeemer descended from Eden like a precious
ark, containing, for all mankind, the bread of life, and the
unsearchable riches of Divine grace.&nbsp; It was conveyed from
the house of Adam to the house of Seth, from the house of Seth to
the house of Noah, from the house of Noah to the house of
Abraham, and thence down through successive generations to the
time of Messiah&rsquo;s advent.&nbsp; The patriarchs, before
their departure, received from this ark invaluable spiritual
blessings, and a passport to the everlasting city; but the ark
itself they left behind for the benefit of their posterity, who
found therein the balm of life, and died in the faith of a
Saviour to come, according to the promise.</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s living Redeemer is none other than the promised
&ldquo;Seed,&rdquo; that should &ldquo;bruise the serpent&rsquo;s
head&rdquo;&mdash;Jacob&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lion,&rdquo;
&ldquo;stooping down&rdquo; to the &ldquo;new tomb hewn out of a
rock,&rdquo; aiming at the King of Terrors, and on the third
morning leaping and &ldquo;rushing upon the prey,&rdquo; and
becoming the plague of death, and the destruction of the
grave&mdash;the &ldquo;Jehovah-jireh&rdquo; of Abraham&mdash;the
&ldquo;I <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>Am,&rdquo; who appeared to Moses in the burning
bush&mdash;the &ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Councillor,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Child-born,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the Everlasting Father,&rdquo; predicted by
Isaiah&mdash;Jeremiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jehovah our
Righteousness&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;Branch&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Fountain&rdquo; of Zachariah&mdash;the &ldquo;Shepherd and
Stone of Israel&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;Shiloh,&rdquo; to whom
should be &ldquo;the gathering of the people&rdquo;&mdash;the
&ldquo;Governor,&rdquo; who should &ldquo;come out of
Bethlehem&rdquo;&mdash;Malachi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sun of
Righteousness&rdquo;&mdash;Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;Captain of our
Salvation,&rdquo; &ldquo;bringing many sons to glory;&rdquo;
opening a tunnel under the river of his own sufferings, and the
seas of human guilt and wo, through which his redeemed might go
home to their Father&rsquo;s house&mdash;Peter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Prince of Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;slain and hung on a
tree&rdquo;&mdash;John&rsquo;s &ldquo;Word,&rdquo; that
&ldquo;was in the beginning with God, and was God;&rdquo; but
&ldquo;was made flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The word here rendered Redeemer, is Goel in the
original; and in the book of Ruth, is translated kinsman, one who
has a right to redeem.&nbsp; The Redeemer is our near kinsman;
for &ldquo;he that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, are
all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An individual in this country returned from India so rich that
he conferred upon all his relatives an independent fortune.&nbsp;
To us also a brother was born against the day of adversity, who
is able to enrich us all with eternal riches.&nbsp; You know not
what hardships your brother endured in the East, while gathering
the wealth you now enjoy; but we know that our brother,
&ldquo;though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we
through his poverty might be rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Naomi returned from the land of Moab, Elimelech, her
husband, was dead, and the inheritance greatly involved in
debt.&nbsp; According to the law of the tribes, the nearest
kinsman of the deceased debtor was obliged to marry the widow,
and redeem the inheritance, so as to retain it in the same
tribe.&nbsp; The purchaser was sought in the land of
Bethlehem.&nbsp; One was found, sufficiently rich, but
unwilling.&nbsp; He preferred to take off his own shoes, before
the elders, at the gate of the city, rather than stand in the
shoes of his deceased brother.&nbsp; It was done, however, by
another, of the name of Boaz.&nbsp; But who will stand in the
place of sinners, who have forfeited all claim to the heavenly
inheritance, and deserve eternal damnation?&nbsp; Let heaven and
earth meet in council, and see who is able and willing to
&ldquo;redeem his brother, or give to God a ransom <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>for
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Earth replies&mdash;&ldquo;There is no such
person here.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the angels around the throne
answer&mdash;&ldquo;There is none in the celestial
city.&rdquo;&nbsp; Search the streets of Jerusalem; go to the
garden of Gethsemane; inquire on the hill of Calvary.&nbsp; Who
is willing to die for sinners to-day?&nbsp; There is the
tree.&nbsp; There is the executioner, with hammer and
nails.&nbsp; Who will offer himself a sacrifice there, for the
redemption of man?&nbsp; None but Jesus.&nbsp; None but Jesus was
able; none but Jesus was willing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here am I,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;if ye seek me, let these go their
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; And without the gates of Jerusalem, he honored
the law, spoiled principalities, and redeemed his people.&nbsp;
He suffered the curse in the sinner&rsquo;s stead, and swallowed
up all its plagues in himself.&nbsp; As your representative, he
endured all the agony and ignominy you justly deserved. <a
name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a>&nbsp; And when you by faith lay hold
of his atonement, you shall be made the righteousness of God in
him&mdash;shall be dealt with, not according to your deserts, but
according to his merit and his mercy.&nbsp; He was humbled that
you might be exalted, impoverished that you might be enriched,
bound that you might be released, punished that you might be
spared, condemned that you might be acquitted, wounded that you
might be healed, cursed that you might be blessed, and slain that
you might live for ever.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Job&rsquo;s faith anticipated a Living
Redeemer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know that my Redeemer
liveth&rdquo;&mdash;is the Living One&mdash;he that has life,
underived and independent, in himself&mdash;the agent and source
of all life in the universe, who will at last quicken the
dead.</p>
<p>The first woman was called Eve&mdash;that is,
Life&mdash;because she was the mother of all living&mdash;the
mother of him who is the life of the world.&nbsp; This was
fulfilled four thousand years afterward in one of her daughters,
a virgin, who brought forth a son, whose name is Jesus, Emmanuel,
the Living God, the true God, and eternal Life.&nbsp; He is the
Lord of life, and the life of all that believe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I live, ye shall live also.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the
flame of one candle you may light many others, and the light of
all is the same.&nbsp; Christ is the source whence all his people
derive their light, the great central luminary of his
church.&nbsp; &ldquo;In him was life, and the life was the light
of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>When
the prophet stood in the valley of dry bones and prophesied,
there was a wonderful agitation, and the bones came together, and
formed themselves into skeletons, and sinews and flesh covered
them, and each form was enclosed with a skin; but they were still
dead, and it was not till the breath of God blew upon them, and
kindled the flame of life within them, that they &ldquo;stood up
an exceeding great army.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Christ is the
resurrection and life alike of the soul and of the body.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He that believeth on him, though he were dead, yet shall
he live.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is the bread and the water of
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that cometh unto him, shall never hunger;
and he that believeth on him, shall never thirst.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the
Son, hath not life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are dead; and our life
is hid with Christ in God; when Christ who is our life shall
appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; The Living Redeemer of Job was to appear in this
world.&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall stand at the latter day upon the
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman who is travelling, and has no money to bear her
expenses, obtains credit on her husband&rsquo;s account, who
afterward passes that way, and discharges the obligation.&nbsp;
So ancient saints went home to glory on credit: and in the
fulness of time, Christ came and paid their debt; not by
installments, but all at once; and the virtue of his own offering
went up to the gate of Eden, and down to the end of the
world.&nbsp; As on both sides of the altar of burnt-offering,
were pipes, conveying the blood into the basins, till they were
full; so the great altar on Calvary communicates with past
generations, and generations yet to come; and the saving merit of
the one sacrifice runs back to Abel and to Adam, and forward to
the last believer.</p>
<p>Whom do I see in the garden yonder, in such agony of soul,
prostrate in prayer, and sweating great drops of blood?&nbsp;
Job&rsquo;s Living Redeemer.&nbsp; Why is his heart thus wrung
with anguish?&nbsp; Is there a dark register of sins in his
conscience, like the fiery handwriting of God upon the
wall?&nbsp; No, he has not a single crime to confess.&nbsp; He
has done no iniquity, neither is guile found in his mouth.&nbsp;
Why then does he suffer?&nbsp; He is bearing our griefs, carrying
our sorrows, and receiving the chastisement of our peace.&nbsp;
Behold him on the mountain, &ldquo;wounded for our
transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;All we like sheep have gone astray; <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>we have
turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him
the iniquity of us all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is brought as a
lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before her shearers is
dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who shall
declare his generation?&rdquo;&nbsp; Who shall give us his
pedigree, his history, his character?&nbsp; Will none of the
angels of heaven make the air of Calvary ring with the
sufferer&rsquo;s name?&nbsp; Behold! the darkened sun and quaking
earth proclaim him God!&nbsp; Hark! he speaks&mdash;&ldquo;I am
the true God, and eternal life.&nbsp; I was set up from
everlasting, from the beginning of the Creator&rsquo;s way, or
ever the earth was.&nbsp; When there was no depths, nor fountains
of water; before the mountains were settled, before the hills was
I brought forth; while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the
fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.&nbsp; When
he prepared the heavens, I was there; when he set a compass upon
the deep; when he established the clouds above; when he
strengthened the foundations of the deep; when he gave the sea
his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment; when
he established the foundations of the earth; then I was by him,
as one brought up with him; and I was daily his delight,
rejoicing always before him; rejoicing in the habitable parts of
his earth, and my delights were with the sons of men; and
therefore I am here, hanging on the cross to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; Job&rsquo;s Living Redeemer was to deliver him from
the power of death.</p>
<p>Job anticipated the coming of &ldquo;the last enemy,&rdquo;
who should give his flesh to be food for worms.&nbsp; The Sabeans
had taken away the oxen and the asses, and slain the servants
with the edge of the sword.&nbsp; The fire had fallen from
heaven, and burnt up the sheep and the shepherds.&nbsp; The
Chaldeans had robbed him of his camels, and murdered his
domestics.&nbsp; The whirlwind had killed his sons and his
daughters in the house of their feasting.&nbsp; His body was
covered with putrid ulcers, from head to foot.&nbsp; His best
friends turned against him, and even his wife tempted him to
&ldquo;curse God and die.&rdquo;&nbsp; But amid all his
calamities, he saw another enemy, ready to assail his body, and
drag it away to the tomb, and reduce it to dust and ashes.&nbsp;
At the same time, his faith beheld the Messiah swallowing up
death in victory.&nbsp; He saw the Son of Mary in the house of
Jairus, where the lion had just slain his victim; and on the
street of Nain, where he was taking the prey to his den; and <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>at the
grave in Bethany, where he was banqueting with worms in the joy
of victory.&nbsp; Death could not stand before the Prince of
Life.&nbsp; The spoiler yielded up his spoil.&nbsp; Christ sailed
on the open channel like a man of war, delivering the hapless
captives of the great pirate Death, to the astonishment and joy
of the people, from Samaria to the borders of Tyre and
Sidon.&nbsp; But on a certain day, ever to be remembered, as he
drew near the ramparts of Sinai, all its batteries were opened
upon him.&nbsp; He stood in the fire all night, and fought till
he sweat great drops of blood.&nbsp; He threw himself between his
friends and the fort, and sustained the shock of its heaviest
artillery, which played upon him without intermission, especially
the old cannon of Eden&mdash;&ldquo;Dying thou shalt
die&rdquo;&mdash;until three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of
the next day, when he received a shot in the heart, and, crying,
&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; gave up the ghost.&nbsp; The whole
creation trembled when he fell, and was swallowed up in the
horrible abyss.&nbsp; But on the morning of the third day, the
earth was seized with new spasms, and he that was dead came forth
to be the life of his people; and the cable of faith, the anchor
of hope, and the sails of love, ascended with him from the deep,
never to go down again.&nbsp; He is alive for evermore, and has
the keys of hell and of death.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; Job speaks of the period of Messiah&rsquo;s advent,
under the term of &ldquo;the latter day.&rdquo;&nbsp; This may
refer, either to the end of the Jewish dispensation, or to the
end of the world.</p>
<p>Christ has already once appeared on earth, fulfilled the types
and shadows, made an end of sins, and brought in everlasting
righteousness; &ldquo;and to them that look for him, he shall
appear the second time, without a sin-offering, unto
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When the Son of man shall come in
his glory, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory, and
before him shall be gathered all nations, and he shall separate
them as the shepherd divideth the sheep from the
goats.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then shall God have finished his work in
mount Zion, and the trumpets of the gospel shall cease to sound,
and the great net shall be taken up from the sea, and the
laborers in the vineyard shall receive their wages, and the tares
shall be cast into the unquenchable fire.</p>
<p>Wonderful shall be the glory and the terror of that day;
&ldquo;when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, with
his mighty angels, in flaming fire; taking vengeance on them that
know not <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>God, and obey not the gospel; who shall be punished
with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and
from the glory of his power; when he shall come to be glorified
in his saints, and admired in all them that believe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What a glorious army shall attend him down the sky&mdash;myriads
of his saints, and all the celestial powers and
principalities!&nbsp; &ldquo;Fire shall devour before him, and it
shall be very tempestuous round about him.&nbsp; He shall call to
the heavens above, and to the earth, that he may judge his
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; His throne shall be &ldquo;like a fiery
flame, and his wheels like a burning furnace.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
&ldquo;shall descend with a shout, and the voice of the
archangel, and the trump of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sound of the
trumpet on Sinai was long and loud, and &ldquo;exceeding
terrible;&rdquo; but how much more powerful shall be the voice of
&ldquo;the last trumpet,&rdquo; penetrating the cold ear of
death, and awaking into immortality the dust of the grave!&nbsp;
Then the Messiah shall not appear &ldquo;as a root out of dry
ground;&rdquo; but shall stand forth before heaven and earth
&ldquo;in the glory of the Father, and of his holy angels;&rdquo;
in addition to the glory of his own person as God-man, and the
glory of his work as Mediator.&nbsp; Before him, &ldquo;the
heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the works that
are therein, shall be burned up;&rdquo; and death and hell shall
deliver up their dead; and all men shall stand and receive their
sentence from him who was an infant in Bethlehem&mdash;&ldquo;a
man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief&rdquo;&mdash;condemned
by Pilate, mocked by the multitude, and nailed upon the
cross.&nbsp; This is Job&rsquo;s living Redeemer, the
resurrection and life of all who believe.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; Our text contains Job&rsquo;s confession of
faith.&nbsp; It is brief, but very comprehensive, and may be
called an epitome of the gospel.&nbsp; Here we have the Divinity
and the humanity of Christ, his work of redemption, his victory
over death and hell, his second advent, and the resurrection of
the dead.</p>
<p>The Athenians mocked when they heard of the resurrection of
the dead; and the Sadducees greatly erred on this subject,
&ldquo;not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God,&rdquo;
and many of the Corinthians imbibed the same poison of
unbelief.&nbsp; But the patriarch of Uz thought it not &ldquo;a
thing incredible that God should raise the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
firmly believed the doctrine, and gave it a prominent place in
his confession.&nbsp; He knew that God is able to watch and
preserve the dust of his saints; has his eye upon every <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>particle,
throughout all the periods of time; and through the Divine
Mediator, &ldquo;will raise it up at the last day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This doctrine was to him a great consolation in his unparalleled
afflictions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though my skin,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;is a tissue of disease and corruption&mdash;yea, though my
body sink into the earth, and be eaten up of the worms, and my
very reins be consumed within me&mdash;yet in my flesh, in this
same body, reorganized, reanimated, and made immortal from the
tomb, I shall see God&mdash;shall see him for myself, with these
self-same eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, brethren; the souls and bodies of all the human race
shall be reunited; and with our own eyes, we shall see the judge
of quick and dead, with his fan in his hand, thoroughly purging
his floor, gathering the wheat into his garner, and burning up
the chaff with unquenchable fire.&nbsp; In that day, the tares
and the wheat shall be for ever separated, and there shall be no
more foolish virgins among the wise.&nbsp; &ldquo;For we must all
appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that we may receive
the things done in the body, according to that we have done,
whether it be good or evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How vast the difference between Messiah&rsquo;s first and
second advents!&nbsp; When he &ldquo;tabernacled and dwelt among
us,&rdquo; he appeared &ldquo;in the form of a servant;&rdquo;
but when he shall come again, he shall come as a judge, and
&ldquo;sit upon the throne of his glory;&rdquo; and &ldquo;all
that are in their graves shall hear his voice, and come forth;
they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they
that have done evil, unto the resurrection of
damnation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For the Son of man shall send
forth his angels; and they shall gather out of his kingdom all
things that offend, and them that do iniquity; and shall cast
them into a furnace of fire; there shall he weeping and gnashing
of teeth; then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the
kingdom of their Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; I call your attention to one other topic suggested
by the text&mdash;the confidence with which Job speaks of his
interest in the living Redeemer.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I know that my
Redeemer liveth.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not a mere conjecture.&nbsp;
There was no doubt in the case.&nbsp; The patriarch had reached
the assurance of faith; and so perfectly satisfied was he of the
fact, that he expressed an intense desire that his words might be
recorded on the most durable materials, that they might be read
by generations to come.</p>
<p>How may we acquire the same confidence?&nbsp; What is the
evidence <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>of our interest in Job&rsquo;s living Redeemer?&nbsp;
The nature and effects of the change which has taken place in our
hearts.&nbsp; You that &ldquo;were sometime darkness, are now
light in the Lord;&rdquo; have been &ldquo;called out of darkness
into his marvellous light;&rdquo; and can say&mdash;&ldquo;One
thing I know, that whereas I was once blind, now I
see.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The carnal mind is enmity against
God;&rdquo; but those that are born of the Spirit love God; and
love and hatred are not so much alike, that you cannot tell by
which principle you are governed.&nbsp; While the strong man
armed kept the palace, his goods were in peace; but when a
stronger than he came and cast him out, there was a warfare
commenced between the old man and the new.&nbsp; You were
formerly dead in trespasses and sins; but are now alive to God,
through our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; You were once destitute of
faith in the Redeemer; but now you believe in him, and rely upon
his righteousness alone, as the ground of your acceptance and
salvation.&nbsp; How can you experience such a transformation,
and know nothing of the matter?&nbsp; As well might the sick,
when Christ healed them&mdash;as well might the blind, when
Christ opened their eyes&mdash;as well might the dead, when
Christ raised them to second life from the bed, the bier, or the
grave&mdash;have been ignorant of the mighty change.</p>
<p>In the word of God, we have the testimony of many who had
obtained the assurance of faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know that my
Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand upon the earth at the
latter day&rdquo;&mdash;was the testimony of Job.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer,
and the horn of my salvation, in whom I will
trust&rdquo;&mdash;was the testimony of David.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will greatly rejoice in the Lord; my soul shall be joyful in God;
for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation; he hath
covered me with the robe of righteousness&rdquo;&mdash;was the
testimony of Isaiah.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know in whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have
committed unto him against that day&rdquo;&mdash;was the
testimony of the apostle Paul.&nbsp; &ldquo;We know that we are
of God; we know that we have passed from death unto life; we know
that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see
him as he is&rdquo;&mdash;was the testimony of John, &ldquo;the
beloved disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These things,&rdquo; saith the apostle, &ldquo;have I
written unto you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that
ye might know that ye have eternal life.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the
design of God, in revealing <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>his will to the church.&nbsp; We
may&mdash;we should know that we have eternal life.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this assurance of faith is not a mere
imagination of the brain.&nbsp; It is not founded on a vague
notion of your being one of the elect, without any other
evidence.&nbsp; It is not founded on a voice from heaven, bidding
you be of good cheer, and go in peace, because your sins are
forgiven you.&nbsp; It is founded on the fruits of the Spirit,
and the testimony of Divine Revelation.&nbsp; True believers are
&ldquo;created anew in Christ Jesus, unto good works;&rdquo;
evincing the reality of their love to God by keeping his
commandments.</p>
<p>Let us, therefore, give all diligence to make our calling and
election sure.&nbsp; Let us examine ourselves, whether we are in
the faith.&nbsp; Let us compare our religion with the precepts of
the Bible, and the example of ancient saints.&nbsp; But as our
hearts are so wicked and deceitful, let us not trust them, but
pray to God for the aid of his Holy Spirit, in this important
work of self-examination.&nbsp; Behold &ldquo;the Sweet Singer of
Israel,&rdquo; praying&mdash;&ldquo;Search me, O God, and try me;
prove me, and know my heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Holy Spirit has
given you a rule by which you are to examine yourselves; and he
works in you a conformity to that rule, and bears witness with
your spirits that you are the children of God.&nbsp; In
proportion to his operation upon the heart, will be the assurance
of faith; and in proportion to the assurance of faith, will be
your spiritual comfort and joy.&nbsp; The Lord grant us that
&ldquo;faith which worketh by love, and purifieth the
heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are you stript of property, bereft of children, afflicted in
body, forsaken of friends, persecuted and insulted by
relatives?&nbsp; Think of Job, and of Job&rsquo;s living
Redeemer!&nbsp; Imitate the patriarch&rsquo;s patience and
confidence amid all the troubles and conflicts of life!&nbsp; Go
your way until the end; for ye shall rest, and stand in your
several lots at last!</p>

140</span>SERMON VII.<br />
MESSIAH&rsquo;S KINGDOM.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>And in the days of these kings shall the
God of heaven set up a kingdom</i>, <i>which shall never be
destroyed</i>: <i>and the kingdom shall not be left to other
people</i>, <i>but it shall break in pieces and consume all these
kingdoms</i>, <i>and it shall stand for ever</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
mountain without hands</i>, <i>and that it brake in pieces the
iron</i>, <i>the brass</i>, <i>the clay</i>, <i>the silver</i>,
<i>and the gold</i>; <i>the great God hath made known to the king
what shall come to pass hereafter</i>; <i>and the dream is
certain</i>, <i>and the interpretation thereof
sure</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Dan. ii. 44, 45.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> these words we have a prophetic
description of the kingdom of Christ, as the fifth empire that
should arise after the date of this prophecy.&nbsp; The wonderful
image which so troubled the king of Babylon in his dream, and
occasioned him so much solicitude when he awoke, denoted four of
the great empires of the world.&nbsp; The head of gold
represented the Babylonian empire; the breasts and arms of
silver, the Medo-Persian empire; the belly and thighs of brass,
the Grecian empire, under Alexander the Great; the legs and feet
of iron, the Roman empire in its strength and glory; and the ten
toes of mingled iron and clay, the same empire in its divided and
enfeebled state.&nbsp; The last circumstance was intended to
denote the same thing as the ten horns on the head of the Beast
in the book of Revelation.&nbsp; As iron is firm and strong, and
able to bruise and break all materials of a softer quality; so
the Roman empire once crushed beneath its power all other
kingdoms, and dictated laws to the world.&nbsp; As the beast with
iron teeth trampled and rent to pieces all that came in its way;
so the Roman tyrant, like a lion among the lambs of the flock,
tore and devoured the followers of the meek and lowly Jesus.</p>
<p>The kingdom of Christ is represented under the figure of
&ldquo;a <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>stone cut out of the mountain without hands:&rdquo;
that is, without human agency&mdash;without any wisdom or power
of man, but by the Spirit of God; smiting the feet of the image,
and shattering it into fragments; then becoming a great mountain,
and filling the whole earth.&nbsp; In the history of Christianity
we have the counterpart of the emblem.&nbsp; Messiah appeared in
the form of a servant; born of a poor virgin, in the despised
town of Bethlehem; lived a life of poverty, persecution, and
various sorrow, from the manger to the tree; died the most
painful and ignominious of deaths, even the accursed death of the
cross; but rose from the dead on the predicted morning, the
morning of the third day; commissioned his apostles, the
fishermen of Galilee, to &ldquo;go into all the world, and preach
the gospel to every creature;&rdquo; ascended on high, and sent
down the Holy Spirit, the promised Comforter, to give energy and
efficacy to the word, to prove its divinity, and convince and
save mankind.&nbsp; The apostles immediately commenced their
work; persevered in the divine employment; were prospered by the
power of God; and the stone, rolling forth from Mount Zion, and
raising a dust which darkened the very heavens, smote the feet
and legs of the image, until it shook, and the earth trembled
around it; and that stone is still rolling on, and shall crush
and demolish the image, and grind it to powder, and scatter it to
the winds of heaven; and shall increase, till it becomes a great
mountain, and fills the whole earth for ever.</p>
<p>In speaking of the accomplishment of this prophecy, we will
notice&mdash;its certainty, its attendant glory, and the nearness
of its approach.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The certainty of the accomplishment of this prophecy
is founded, <i>first</i>, on the Father&rsquo;s promise to the
Son, made on the express condition of his pouring out his soul
unto death.&nbsp; &ldquo;I the Lord have called thee in
righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and
give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the
Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring forth the prisoners
from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the
prison-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s universal dominion is
the promised reward of his sufferings, and the Father speaks as
if he intended to raise his wages.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus saith the
Lord; It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant, to
raise up the tribes of Jacob, and restore the preserved of
Israel; I will also give thee for a light of the <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>gentiles,
that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ask of me, and I shall give thee the
heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
earth for thy possession.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the promise.&nbsp;
All nations shall come and worship before him.&nbsp; All that the
Father hath given shall come unto him, and the gates of hell
shall not prevail against them.</p>
<p>The certainty of Messiah&rsquo;s universal dominion is
founded, <i>secondly</i>, on his perfect qualification to
accomplish the work which the Father hath given him to do.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No one knoweth the Father,&rdquo; in all the perfection of
his nature, all the wisdom of his counsels, and all the
immutability of his purposes, &ldquo;but the Son; and no one
knoweth the Son, but the Father,&rdquo; as he alone is of the
same essence, and exhibits the same attributes.&nbsp; Christ is
&ldquo;God manifest in the flesh;&rdquo; &ldquo;the brightness of
the Father&rsquo;s glory, and the express image of his
person.&rdquo;&nbsp; None but a divine person could give, and
none but a divine person could receive, such a privilege as is
here promised.&nbsp; None but a divine person could be competent
to the eternal redemption of countless millions of the human
race.&nbsp; Christ &ldquo;is the true God, and Eternal
Life&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the Faithful Witness, the First Begotten
from the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the
earth&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and
the Ending, the First and the Last&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the Root
and the Offspring of David, and the Bright and Morning
Star&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Over all, God, blessed for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are Messiah&rsquo;s titles, which evince
his equality to the work which he has undertaken&mdash;the
salvation of the world, and the subjugation of all things unto
himself.&nbsp; He is able, not only to set up his kingdom, but
also to establish it for ever.&nbsp; It shall never be destroyed,
nor left to other people; but shall break in pieces and destroy
all other kingdoms, and the kingdoms of this world shall become
the kingdom of our God and of his Christ.</p>
<p>Take courage, ye fearful saints!&nbsp; Your king is the
Almighty God.&nbsp; He shall conquer all your enemies.&nbsp; The
victory of Calvary is the pledge and earnest of his universal
dominion.&nbsp; You shall soon be more than conquerors, through
him that hath loved you, and given himself for you.&nbsp; He is
able to protect you against the combined powers of earth and
hell.&nbsp; Omniscient, he is well acquainted with all the plots
of his enemies; Almighty, he can at any moment frustrate
them.&nbsp; The prince of darkness, with all his hosts, cannot
impede the progress of his kingdom.&nbsp; In all their councils,
he is <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>present, hearing their deliberations and discovering
their malice.&nbsp; He overturns their schemes, or employs them
for the accomplishment of his own gracious purposes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His counsel shall stand, and he will do all his
pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Too wise to err, and too powerful to be
overcome, he marches in the van of battle, and will never forsake
his soldiers.&nbsp; The very sight of his helmet and his plume is
victory to his followers, and death to his foes.</p>
<p>Courage, ye friends of Zion!&nbsp; &ldquo;Lift up your hearts
and rejoice, for your redemption draweth nigh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Take
the whole armor of God; quit you like men; be strong; for the
decisive conflict is at hand.&nbsp; Behold your General, clothed
with a garment white as snow, girt about the loins with a golden
girdle, his feet as fine brass burning in a furnace, his
countenance as the sun shining in his strength, his eyes as a
flame of fire, his voice as the sound of many waters, a sharp
two-edged sword proceeding out of his mouth, seven stars in his
right hand, and at his girdle the keys of death and hell.&nbsp;
This is the Captain of your salvation, of whom the Evangelical
Prophet inquires&mdash;&ldquo;Who is this that cometh from Edom,
with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his
apparel, travelling in the greatness of his
strength?&rdquo;&nbsp; This is Emmanuel; mighty to conquer, and
mighty to save.&nbsp; Who can stand before the glory of his
power?&nbsp; Who can hinder the universal triumph of his
cause?&nbsp; The government shall be upon his shoulder, and he
shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
<p>What has been said is deemed sufficient to show the certainty
of Messiah&rsquo;s universal empire.&nbsp; The promises of the
Father to the Son are so many drafts of immense amount, upon the
bank of heaven, which will be paid without discount at the
appointed time; and the character of Christ is a sufficient
guarantee that he will carry forward to its completion the work
which he has begun.&nbsp; Having secured a title to the kingdom
by his sufferings, he shall certainly come, and take possession,
and reign for ever.&nbsp; The gospel is a lever, whose fulcrum is
the Rock of Ages, and it shall yet lift our fallen world to
heaven.&nbsp; Balaam knew that his curses could not injure
Israel, whom Jehovah had blessed.&nbsp; The kingdom of Messiah is
mightier than Moab.&nbsp; The people beloved of the Lord shall
prosper in spite of their enemies&mdash;as gardens by the rivers,
and willows by the water-courses.&nbsp; &ldquo;There shall be a
handful of corn,&rdquo; not a sackful, only so much as the sower
may hold in his <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>hand&mdash;not on the bank of the Nile, nor in the
valley of the Jordan, but &ldquo;on the top of the
mountain&rdquo;&mdash;the wild, high, rocky, uncultivated
mountain; &ldquo;the fruit thereof shall shake like
Lebanon,&rdquo; and the wind shall carry the seed to the
uttermost parts of the earth, and young Lebanons shall grow up
everywhere, and even the barren rocks and sands of Arabia shall
become as the garden of God.&nbsp; It was but a handful of the
seed of the kingdom, which Peter cast abroad on the day of
Pentecost; it was but a handful he sowed in the house of
Cornelius, the captain of the Italian band; but it soon spread
throughout Judea, and even to the isles of the sea, so that
nothing was more manifest or more abundant than its fruit.&nbsp;
But the prevalence of Christ&rsquo;s millennial kingdom shall be
still more rapid and glorious; and &ldquo;from the rising to the
setting of the sun, his name shall be great among the
Gentiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the church is singing&mdash;&ldquo;Gird thy sword upon
thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty; and in thy majesty, ride
prosperously, because of truth, and meekness, and
righteousness.&nbsp; Thine arrows are sharp in the hearts of the
king&rsquo;s enemies, whereby the people fall under
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The song has reached the ear of the Prince of
Darkness, and he &ldquo;hath come in great wrath&rdquo; to the
battle, &ldquo;for he knoweth that he hath but a short
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knows that &ldquo;the Desire of
nations&rdquo; is come; and that his kingdom, already begun,
shall be established for ever, and extend from sea to sea, till
the knowledge of his glory and the victories of his grace shall
cover the earth.&nbsp; He sees the Stone rolling against the
idols of India, and Africa, and the islands of the sea, and feels
his kingdom shake beneath its progress.&nbsp; He sees the
Bramins, the Karens, the worshippers of Juggernaut and the
Ganges, plucked as brands out of the burning.&nbsp; He trembles
to anticipate the announcement&mdash;&ldquo;The kingdoms of this
world are become the kingdom of our Lord and of his
Christ!&rdquo;&nbsp; He beholds the mighty angel, with the keys
of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand, descending
from heaven, to bind him in his prison.&nbsp; He hates the
church, with her various benevolent enterprises; for he sees in
them the artillery of Heaven, playing upon his fortresses of
infidelity, and idolatry, and vice&mdash;the enginery of God,
setting up a kingdom which shall consume all others, and stand
for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dream is certain, and the
interpretation thereof is sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; We call your attention to the glory of
Messiah&rsquo;s universal <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>reign.&nbsp; It includes three
things; the victory obtained, the blessings bestowed, and the
duration of the kingdom.&nbsp; Let us consider them
distinctly.</p>
<p><i>First</i>.&nbsp; The victory obtained.&nbsp; Here we behold
the &ldquo;stone cut out of the mountain,&rdquo; rolling down the
steep, rushing and leaping toward the great image, and smiting
and breaking its feet of iron and clay, so that it falls like
Dagon before the ark.&nbsp; And still the Stone, instinct with
the power of God, and increasing in size and velocity, keeps
rolling to and fro, bounding and rebounding, till it grinds the
fallen image to powder, and scatters it as the dust of the summer
thrashing-floor.&nbsp; It is endued with perpetual motion;
keeping up a constant action and reaction, crushing whatever
opposes its progress, and growing to such a magnitude as shall
shortly fill the whole earth.&nbsp; This is the salt of Galilee,
seasoning the nations&mdash;the leaven of Jerusalem, spreading
through the world.&nbsp; This is the victorious reign of Christ,
from the Tiber to the Thames, from the Euphrates to the Ganges,
from Britain to Japan, from sea to sea, and from pole to
pole.&nbsp; This glorious conquest is to be obtained by
&ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;&rdquo;
in connection with the vast machinery of Divine Providence, all
the wheels of which are under the direction of Jesus the
Christ.&nbsp; It is a victory over Satan, by bruising his head; a
victory over sin, by destroying its power; a victory over death,
by swallowing it up for ever.&nbsp; Emmanuel has already
successfully engaged all these foes; and having routed them on
Calvary eighteen hundred years ago, he still pursues their
flight; and shall not turn again, till he has trampled &ldquo;the
last enemy&rdquo; under his feet.</p>
<p>Satan is the prince and the god of this world.&nbsp; In the
management of his affairs, he employs a policy similar to that of
the Sultan of Constantinople, who sets up many pashas or
governors under him, as the Pasha of Egypt, the Pasha of Aleppo,
the Pasha of Damascus, all possessing the same despotic spirit,
and carrying out the same tyrannical measures.&nbsp; The devil
has established a great number of pashas throughout his
dominion.&nbsp; Three of them are described by the Revelator, as
unclean spirits, like frogs; one of them issuing from the mouth
of Satan himself, representing undisguised Paganism; another from
the mouth of the Beast, representing a persecuting civil power;
the third from the mouth of the False Prophet, representing
abominable and damnable heresies.&nbsp; <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>But these
shall all be conquered; these, and every other enemy of Messiah
upon earth.&nbsp; Jewish impenitence and unbelief, which, for a
period of eighteen centuries, has ruled with an absolute sceptre
the lineal descendants of Abraham, shall be overcome.&nbsp;
Mohammedism, the &ldquo;king of fierce countenance, understanding
dark sentences,&rdquo; that has reigned over so large a portion
of the world, practicing and prospering, deceiving millions of
souls, and destroying the holy people, shall be broken without
hand, and his kingdom shall come to naught.&nbsp; The drunken
harlot of Rome, riding on her scarlet beast, that is, a cruel and
persecuting civil government, and making all nations drink of the
wine of her fornication, shall be obliged to drink the wine of
the wrath of Almighty God; and all the saints shall clap their
hands at her overthrow, and shout hallelujah to the Captain of
their salvation.&nbsp; And all those Protestant pashas of Satan,
who would undermine the gospel by denying its peculiar and
fundamental doctrines&mdash;such as the Divinity of Christ, the
merit of his sacrifice, the excellency of his offices, the
personality and work of the Holy Spirit&mdash;and even the
existence of his own infernal majesty, shall be destroyed by the
brightness of Emmanuel&rsquo;s coming, when he shall appear in
the glory of his millennial kingdom.&nbsp; Then shall the song of
the heavenly host break once more upon the ear of
Zion&mdash;&ldquo;Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the
glory of the Lord is risen upon thee!&rdquo;&nbsp; And &ldquo;the
Gentiles shall come to her light, and kings to the brightness of
her rising.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Her sons shall come from far, and
her daughters shall be nursed at her side.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The glory of the Lord shall be displayed, and all flesh
shall see it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>.&nbsp; The blessings bestowed.&nbsp; Christ
&ldquo;hath ascended on high, and received gifts for men; yea for
the rebellious also, that God may dwell among them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The celestial reservoir is full; and the golden pipes are laid,
for conveying the waters of life to every soul of man; and the
time shall yet come, when all shall know the Lord, from the least
to the greatest.&nbsp; The gospel salvation shall be an ocean,
spreading over the whole earth; and there shall be no more ebbing
and flowing of the waters, but a continual full tide from shore
to shore.&nbsp; The Chinese, the Hottentot, and the American
Indian, shall be as thoroughly instructed in Divine things as the
Welshman; and the Welshman shall be seven times more intelligent
than now.&nbsp; And this universally prevalent knowledge of <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Christ
shall be, not merely nominal and theoretical, but experimental
and practical.&nbsp; It shall be a &ldquo;faith unfeigned,&rdquo;
&ldquo;of the operation of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;working by love,
and purifying the heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The light of the gospel
shall be &ldquo;as the sun shining in his strength,&rdquo;
scattering all clouds from the face of the world, and the moon
and the stars shall be lost in its effulgence.&nbsp; Living
waters shall flow out from the spiritual Jerusalem in summer and
winter; neither frozen by the cold, nor evaporated by the
heat.&nbsp; Like the deluge of Noah, they shall cover the
mountains; but they shall save, and not destroy, all whom they
shall overwhelm.&nbsp; &ldquo;In that day, there shall be one
Lord, and his name shall be one;&rdquo; and he &ldquo;shall be
king over all the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cause of Christ shall
be pre-eminent in the estimation of mankind.&nbsp; The duties and
interests of Christianity shall constitute no secondary
concern.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mountain of the Lord&rsquo;s house
shall be established in the tops of the mountains, and exalted
above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the blessings of this happy period, shall be that of a
universal and everlasting peace.&nbsp; There shall be no more
contention and bloodshed upon earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nation shall no
more lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
any more.&rdquo;&nbsp; The arsenals shall empty their contents
into the foundries and blacksmith-shops, and the weapons of war
shall be converted into scythes and plowshares.&nbsp; O, glorious
day! when heaven shall be seen upon earth, and earth itself shall
seem like heaven!&nbsp; Behold the ferocious wolf dwelling with
the gentle lamb; the furious leopard lying down with the innocent
kid; the cow and the bear feeding in the same pasture; the infant
leading the lion by the mane, and playing upon the den of the
adder and the asp; and no disposition to hurt or destroy.&nbsp;
These are the scriptural emblems of that blessed peace.&nbsp;
Holiness and happiness, more united than David and Jonathan, more
inseparable than Ruth and Naomi, hand in hand, two heavenly
twins, shall go singing over the world.&nbsp; All envy and
jealousy and hostility, whether of nations, of churches, or of
individuals, shall perish before Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom, as
perished the image in the vision before that wondrous stone.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>.&nbsp; The duration of the kingdom.&nbsp; This
is the crowning circumstance of its glory.&nbsp; It &ldquo;shall
not be destroyed, nor left to other people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its
enemies, however numerous and mighty, cannot overthrow it; and it
&ldquo;shall stand for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where now are the <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>illustrious
empires of Babylon, and Persia, and Greece, and Rome?&nbsp; Where
are the Pharaohs, the Ptolemies, the Alexanders, the
C&aelig;sars, the Napoleons, whose voice terrified nations, and
whose tread shook the world?&nbsp; Where&mdash;with all their
power and splendor, their iron sceptres and golden crowns?&nbsp;
Gone; mouldering in the dust; and their magnificence nourishes
the worm.&nbsp; They are utterly demolished, and shall rise no
more.&nbsp; But the King of Zion liveth through all time, and is
himself &ldquo;the Father of Eternity,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Alpha
and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the
Last.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
and of his dominion there shall be no end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Let us consider the nearness of its approach.&nbsp;
The language of prophecy, viewed in connection with the signs of
the times, will lead us to the conclusion that it is nigh at
hand, even at the door.</p>
<p>Many learned divines are of opinion that Popery and
Mohammedism, the Antichrists of the east and the west, must fall
about the year 1866.&nbsp; This notion is founded on the
following words: &ldquo;From the time that the daily sacrifice
shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set
up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and threescore
days&mdash;Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand
three hundred and five and thirty days.&rdquo; <a
name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148"
class="citation">[148]</a>&nbsp; Different writers on the
prophecies, however, differ in opinion concerning the times of
their fulfilment.&nbsp; All these speculations are very
uncertain, if not utterly unprofitable.&nbsp; What matters it, if
our watches do not exactly agree?&nbsp; We all know that the
night is far spent, and the day is at hand, and the magnitude and
importance of our duty requires prompt and earnest attention.</p>
<p>Five men were determined to rise early in the morning, to
engage in a great work, upon which depended their future
fortunes.&nbsp; The first was up before the morning star; and
though uncertain as to the hour, immediately prepared for
business.&nbsp; The second, when he rose, saw the star just above
the horizon, and hastened to his work with animation and
joy.&nbsp; The third slept a little too long, and awoke in great
confusion and alarm; but hurrying through the day as well as he
could, though with a heavy heart and many a blunder, he made out
partially to redeem his delinquency.&nbsp; The <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>fourth
heard the cock crowing, but thought there was no need of being in
a hurry, and composed himself to sleep again; and when his
neighbors called him, turned in his bed, and
answered&mdash;&ldquo;A little more slumber;&rdquo; and awaking
about nine of the clock, found the day too far advanced, and
abandoned his purpose in despair.&nbsp; The fifth, disturbed by
the bustle of the others before daylight, got up and looked out
of the window; and finding it as dark as it was at midnight, was
very angry, called his neighbors a set of fools, and declared he
would have nothing to do with the enterprise; and while all the
others made themselves rich, he lived and died in deserved
poverty; and some pitied him for his misfortune, and others
ridiculed him for his folly.&nbsp; Mark the wise man, and follow
his example.</p>
<p>The kingdom of Antichrist has of late been greatly weakened in
many parts of the world.&nbsp; Providence is pouring the vials of
wrath upon the Beast and the False Prophet.&nbsp; The idols and
altars of Paganism fall before the advancing ark of God.&nbsp;
The church, with its train of benevolent institutions&mdash;like
the bride, with her attendant virgins, going forth to meet the
royal bridegroom&mdash;proclaims the coming of the Prince of
Peace.&nbsp; The Bible, Missionary, Sabbath-school, and Tract
societies, are four heralds, running before Messiah&rsquo;s
chariot; rather, the four wheels of that chariot in which he
rides victoriously.</p>
<p>The rise and progress of the British and Foreign Bible Society
remind me of the stream in Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision.&nbsp; This
great river had its source in one of the mountains of
Wales.&nbsp; In the year 1802, the Rev. Mr. Charles of Bala, an
ordained minister of the established church, officiating in
connection with the Calvinistic Methodists, deeply impressed with
the preciousness of the Bible, and aware of the scarcity of
copies throughout the principality, felt that some measures ought
to be adopted to furnish it at a reduced price, and circulate it
gratuitously among the poor.&nbsp; He wrote concerning it to his
countryman, the Rev. Mr. Owen, an Episcopal clergyman in
London.&nbsp; The subject was subsequently introduced to a circle
of Christian gentlemen, who had met to transact other
business.&nbsp; It elicited much conversation, and excited a
lively interest.&nbsp; The Rev. Joseph Hughes, a Welshman, and
Baptist minister at Battersea, near London, suggested that Wales
was not the only part of the world that felt a want of the Bread
of Life; and that it was <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>desirable to awaken, if possible, a
more extensive interest on the subject among Christians of every
name; and stir them up to the adoption of some measure, which
might lead to a general circulation of the Scriptures.&nbsp; The
suggestion was heartily entertained, and warmly supported by the
rest of the company; and its discussion led to those incipient
efforts, which, in 1804, issued in the organization of the
British and Foreign Bible Society.&nbsp; The little spring of
Bala soon became a stream large enough for a man to swim in; and
now it widens and deepens into a great river, on which float the
merchandise of Zion, and the navies of God.</p>
<p>Welshmen! it is your privilege and honor, as well as your
duty, to sustain this excellent institution.&nbsp; It is a native
of Wales, born in your northern mountains.&nbsp; It is your own
child, and you are bound to protect and support it to the extent
of your ability.&nbsp; I call upon you as Welshmen, to aid an
institution originating in Welsh philanthropy.&nbsp; I call upon
you as Welsh Baptists, to help forward an enterprise which sprang
from the heart of a Welsh Baptist minister.&nbsp; I appeal to you
in the language of another:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cause in which we are engaged is the cause of God,
and must succeed.&nbsp; Divine goodness has inspired, divine
wisdom and power will sustain it.&nbsp; The Bible will be carried
throughout the habitable globe.&nbsp; Nor deserts&mdash;nor
oceans&mdash;nor Alpine solitudes&mdash;nor Himalayan heights,
will obstruct its progress.&nbsp; It will go through polar ice
and equatorial fire, wherever a soul may possibly be saved.&nbsp;
It will go on victorious, like the sword of the Lord and of
Gideon, carrying every thing before it.&nbsp; Error and delusion
must vanish as the mists of the morning before the rising
splendor of the sun.&nbsp; The powers of darkness must recede
like spectres before the bursting of the day-spring from on
high.&nbsp; False gods and their altars must fall together in the
dust.&nbsp; The followers of Confucius and Zoroaster will take up
their cross and follow Christ.&nbsp; The wandering Arab will sit
and sing at Messiah&rsquo;s feet; and the deluded disciples of
Mohammed, instead of going in painful pilgrimage to Mecca, will
turn their penitent eyes to Calvary.&nbsp; The dark places of the
earth will be enlightened, and the habitations of cruelty will
become the abodes of love.&nbsp; Rivers will no longer roll with
human blood, nor sacrificial fires be fed with human
victims.&nbsp; Mothers will no longer destroy their innocent
children, nor aged parents be immolated by their inhuman
offspring.&nbsp; Marriage will be instituted <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>in places
where it is now unknown, and savage practices be supplanted by
the virtuous institutions of the gospel.&nbsp; The Cannibal of
New Zealand will be humanized, and the Caffre and the Hottentot
clothed and in their right minds.&nbsp; The descendants of
Abraham must be gathered from the four quarters of the earth;
Jerusalem arise and shine; and the dejected Jordan roll his
streams with joy.&nbsp; Barren climes will teem with
life&mdash;dreary deserts blossom as the rose.&nbsp; Rivers of
salvation will run down the hills, and fertilize the
plains.&nbsp; The Saviour will ride forth in the chariot of the
everlasting gospel, conquering and to conquer.&nbsp; Nations will
fall down before him, and mountains melt at his approach.&nbsp;
And thus nation after nation will be converted, and empire upon
empire will be conquered; and Christianity will spread from clime
to clime, and from pole to pole; until the final arrival of the
blessed day, when the knowledge of the Lord shall literally cover
the earth as the waters cover the deep&mdash;when there shall be
but one people and one God&mdash;when the millennial day shall
burst upon the earth, like a flood of glory from on
high&mdash;when the trump of Jubilee shall sound, and countless
millions of the redeemed shall sing, Hallelujah! the Lord God
omnipotent reigneth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such, brethren, is the approaching triumph of Emmanuel.&nbsp;
The mighty angel, having found an old copy of the everlasting
gospel, which the Pope had kept locked up in his bureau for many
centuries, is flying in the midst of heaven, in sight of all the
world.&nbsp; His progress is rapid as the wings of the wind, and
his sweet strong voice is publishing the glad tidings to all
people.&nbsp; But we look for greater things than these.&nbsp;
Following, comes another mighty angel, casting a great millstone
into the sea, and saying&mdash;&ldquo;Thus shall Babylon, that
great city, be thrown down, and found no more at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another follows, crying with a loud
voice&mdash;&ldquo;Babylon is fallen, is fallen!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another descends with the key and the chain, and binds the dragon
in the bottomless pit.&nbsp; Then appears one &ldquo;like unto
the Son of Man,&rdquo; sitting upon a white cloud, and wearing a
golden crown.&nbsp; He thrusts in his sharp sickle, and reaps the
harvest of the earth, and gathers the wheat into his garner, the
church.&nbsp; Again the sickle falls, and the vintage of
wickedness is gathered, and cast into the wine-press of the wrath
of Almighty God.&nbsp; Then comes the voice of a great multitude,
as of many waters and mighty thunderings&mdash;the blended <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>minstrelsy
of earth and heaven&mdash;ascribing salvation and dominion and
glory to him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for
ever and ever.</p>
<p>The Prince of Darkness, with all his infernal hosts, and all
his allies upon earth, is fearfully agitated, as he witnesses the
preparation for the great decisive battle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why so
much benevolence?&nbsp; Why so many societies?&nbsp; Why such
extraordinary schemes and efforts?&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing disturbs
them so much as the sight of Emmanuel&rsquo;s troops, with their
faces toward the field of Armageddon, led on by the Captain of
their Salvation, on his white horse, with his vesture dipped in
blood.&nbsp; They know that this is the Lion of the tribe of
Judah; and the redness of his apparel, reminding them of their
defeat when he bruised their heads on Calvary, shoots
consternation and anguish through all their ranks; and the gates
of hell tremble at the shaking of the iron rod in his hand, which
shall dash them in pieces as a potter&rsquo;s vessel.&nbsp; But
the saints are rejoicing in his train; for they know that not one
of the faithful shall perish&mdash;that not one of them shall be
wounded&mdash;that each shall be more than conqueror, and all
shall appear with songs of everlasting joy at the marriage supper
of the Lamb.</p>
<p>And now, my brethren, children of my heavenly Father, of every
name and order, loved with the same love, redeemed with the same
blood, called by the same Spirit, clothed with the same garment,
fed on the same manna, engaged in the same cause&mdash;the great
Missionary enterprise&mdash;as you love the Savior, as you
appreciate his salvation, as you desire the introduction of his
millennial kingdom, we beseech you to give us a liberal
contribution!</p>
<p>We are now ready to receive your money for Missionary
purposes; and while you are casting it into the treasury, let me
remind you that your gold and your silver are beautiful birds
plumed for flight, that Christian liberality is the scissors with
which you may clip their wings, and a short winged bird is better
than none.&nbsp; May we all act to-day as stewards of the Lord,
in the immediate presence of our Master, before whom we must soon
appear to account for the use made of our talents; and when the
time of reckoning shall come, may each receive the gracious
plaudit&mdash;&ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant! thou
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many!&nbsp; Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Amen.</p>

153</span>SERMON VIII.<br />
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Who</i>, <i>his own self</i>, <i>bore
our sins</i>, <i>in his own body</i>, <i>on the tree</i>; <i>that
we</i>, <i>being dead to sins</i>, <i>should live unto
righteousness</i>; <i>by whose stripes ye were
healed</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;I Peter ii. 24.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> great encouragement to
patience and fortitude is afforded the followers of Jesus, by the
apostle&rsquo;s contrast of the light and transient afflictions
of the present time, with the eternal weight of glory reserved
for them in heaven!&nbsp; How forcible the argument which he
draws from the approaching scenes of another world, to urge
Christians in this to a life of holiness and self-denial!&nbsp;
How vivid and terrible his picture of the dissolution of nature
by the great conflagration!&nbsp; Imagine the heavens wrapped in
dissolving flames, and the elements melting to the centre of the
globe.&nbsp; The victorious and inextinguishable fire towers to
the empyrean; the magnificent palace of creation is lost in the
smoke of its own burning; and the ear is stunned, and the soul is
horrified, by the crash of its final fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seeing
then, that all these things must be dissolved, what manner of
persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness;
looking for, and hasting unto the coming of the day of
God;&rdquo; &ldquo;using all diligence to make your calling and
election sure;&rdquo; &ldquo;that ye may be found of him in
peace, without spot, and blameless;&rdquo; that &ldquo;so an
abundant entrance may be ministered unto you, into the
everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such, substantially, is the argument.&nbsp; But the apostle
employs another; the Christian&rsquo;s obligation to imitate
Christ, suffering for him as he suffered for us, with the same
fortitude and resignation, though not to the same extent, nor for
the same purpose.&nbsp; It is in <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>this connection he uses the language
of the text:&mdash;&ldquo;Servants, be subject to your masters
with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the
froward.&nbsp; For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience
toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.&nbsp; For what
glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall
take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye
take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.&nbsp; For even
hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us,
leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did
no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was
reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not;
but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: who his
own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we,
being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose
stripes ye were healed.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are to suffer for Christ
as his disciples and confessors; he suffered for us as our
substitute, our atoning sacrifice and Saviour.&nbsp; Let us
attend, first, to this description of his sufferings; and then to
the end for which he endured them.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The text describes Christ in his vicarious
sufferings, as <i>bearing our sins</i>; bearing our sins, <i>his
own self</i>; bearing our sins, his own self, <i>in his own
body</i>; and bearing our sins, his own self, in his own body,
<i>on the tree</i>,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>He bore our sins</i>.&nbsp; To get a correct
understanding of this expression, we must turn to the record of
the ordinance to which it alludes, which is as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;And when he hath made an end of reconciling
the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the
altar, he shall bring the live goat, and Aaron shall lay both his
hands upon the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities
of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, in all
their sins, putting them on the head of the goat; and shall send
him away, by the hand of a fit man, into the wilderness; and the
goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities into a land not
inhabited; and he shall let go the goat in the
wilderness.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this part of the ceremony was
preceded by another, of very solemn import.&nbsp; A goat was
selected for a sin-offering.&nbsp; He was brought before the
Lord, and Aaron put his hands upon him, and devoted him to
death.&nbsp; He was slain, and his blood was sprinkled upon the
altar and the mercy-seat.&nbsp; Then the sins of the children of
Israel were laid upon the head of the other goat, and he was led
forth, and <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>sent away into the wilderness, to return no more.&nbsp;
Both these goats represented Christ; who, as our Savior, answers
to both; at once, suffering for our sins, and bearing them away
into the land of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Three things were found continually in the temple; fire, and
blood, and sweet incense.&nbsp; The fire denoted the wrath of God
against sin; the blood prefigured the sacrificial sufferings of
Christ; and the sweet incense typified his intercession at the
right hand of the Father, on the ground of his vicarious death
upon the cross.&nbsp; The goat of the sin-offering was bound and
slain; and then burnt up, with the fat thereof, upon the
altar.&nbsp; So Christ was crucified for us without the gates of
Jerusalem; and his humanity was consumed by the fire of
God&rsquo;s holy indignation against sin, on the altar of his
Divinity; while from that altar ascended a column of the sweetest
incense to the heaven of heavens&mdash;&ldquo;Father, forgive
them!&rdquo;&nbsp; In hell also there is fire, where sinners
suffer upon the altars of eternal justice.&nbsp; Every sacrifice
is salted with fire, and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up
for ever and ever.&nbsp; But the black and sulphurous smoke of
the bottomless pit is not a sweet smelling savor unto God, like
the fumes of the sacrifice once offered on Calvary&mdash;a
sacrifice which satisfied the claim of Heaven, and expiated the
offence of earth.</p>
<p>The form of expression used in our text is one which
frequently occurs in the Old Testament, and signifies the
enduring of punishment.&nbsp; Of the impenitent sinner it is
said, &ldquo;He shall bear his iniquity&rdquo;&mdash;that is, he
shall endure the just punishment of his sins.&nbsp; He shall
carry the burden alone, and for ever sink beneath the load, and
mercy shall never come to his relief.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s
bearing our sins, then, signifies his enduring, the punishment in
our stead.&nbsp; Glory to God, that every poor trembling sinner
may cast his burden upon one who is able to sustain it, who has
already sustained it in his stead!&nbsp; The law passed the
guilty, and arrested the guiltless.&nbsp; Jesus willingly gave
himself up as the victim, saying&mdash;&ldquo;I am he; if ye seek
me, let these go their way.&rdquo;&nbsp; His sufferings
constitute the sea, in which are buried for ever the sins of his
people; sins of the greatest magnitude; sins of the deepest
dye.&nbsp; The Father, who turned his back upon the sufferings of
his Son, hath said&mdash;&ldquo;I will cast all thy sins behind
my back, into the depth of the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the
abyss, in which they are swallowed up, and seen no more.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>2.&nbsp; He bore our sins, <i>his own self</i>.&nbsp;
God and man were parties at variance.&nbsp; There was but one who
could stand between them as mediator, and he gave himself a
substitute and sacrifice for the sinner.&nbsp; Uniting in his
person the two natures, human and Divine, he was fully qualified
for his work; and by once offering himself, he satisfied the
demands of the insulted law, and &ldquo;became the author of
eternal salvation to all them that obey him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
offered up himself, without the aid of another; and it was his
own blessed person that he threw between you and the destroying
angel, between you and the mortal plague of sin, between you and
the unquenchable fires of hell.</p>
<p>None but Moses, the mediator, could penetrate the thick
darkness in which, as in a pavilion, God dwelt, upon the mount of
terror; and none but Aaron, the high-priest, dared enter the holy
of holies, and he only once a year, on the great day of
atonement, with trembling steps, and sacrificial blood.&nbsp; So
Jesus, the mediator of a better covenant, and high-priest of the
true sanctuary, the sum and substance of all the types and
shadows of the old dispensation, when, in the garden of
Gethsemane, he approached the black and terrible cloud, where God
revealed the terrors of his justice, and the fierceness of his
wrath, said to his disciples:&mdash;&ldquo;Tarry ye here, while I
go yonder.&nbsp; Ye cannot go; the place is too dreadful.&nbsp; I
will go alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alone he went; and as he drew near
the furnace, his countenance was marvellously altered, his heart
melted in the midst of his bowels, and the very substance of his
life pressed through the pores of his skin.&nbsp; All the visible
fire which flamed on the summit of Sinai, now breaks forth anew
on Calvary; and though unseen by man, envelopes in its burning
the soul and the body of our glorious Substitute.&nbsp; Behold
him rushing between you and the flames, shielding you, and
quenching the flames in his blood!</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; He bore our sins, his own self, <i>in his own
body</i>.&nbsp; Atonement was made for the sins of Israel by the
blood of slaughtered beasts.&nbsp; But &ldquo;the blood of bulls
and goats, and the ashes of an heifer, sprinkling the unclean,
sanctified only to the purifying of the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
blood of Christ alone has power to &ldquo;purge the conscience
from dead works, to serve the living God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was his
own body, that our blessed Redeemer offered as a sacrifice for
our sins, a sacrifice of a sweet savor unto God.&nbsp; The Divine
person bore the <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>punishment of sins in human nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away
sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; We hear the Son saying to the
Father:&mdash;&ldquo;Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not,
but a body hast thou prepared for me.&nbsp; I see that the
services of the altar are of no avail, and are passing
away.&nbsp; In burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast
no pleasure.&nbsp; At this moment, the great cause of difference
between heaven and earth remains untaken away.&nbsp; The bills
are all uncancelled.&nbsp; The handwriting in the book of the
law, and in the book of conscience, continues in full force unto
this day.&nbsp; But lo, I come to do thy will, O my God.&nbsp;
Yea, thy law is within my heart.&nbsp; I delight to honor its
claims, while I save its violaters.&nbsp; I will obey, even unto
the death of the cross, and expiate human transgression by my
meritorious sufferings.&nbsp; Then, as first begotten from the
dead, will I declare the decree which thou didst read to me
before the foundation of the world&mdash;&lsquo;Thou art my Son;
this day have I begotten thee.&nbsp; Because I have bruised thee,
and put thee to grief, thou shalt see thy seed, and prolong thy
days; and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in thy
hand.&nbsp; Because thou hast borne the sins of many, thou shall
justify many.&nbsp; Because thou hast been numbered with the
transgressors, and made intercession for them, thou shalt see of
the travail of thy soul, and be satisfied.&nbsp; Because thou
hast made thy soul an offering for sin, pouring it out unto
death, I will divide thee a portion with the great, and thou
shalt divide the spoil with the strong.&nbsp; I will make thee
king in Zion, and thou shalt reign for ever and
ever!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sufferings of the Son are accomplished, and the promise of
the Father is receiving its fulfilment.&nbsp; The law of the
Spirit of Life hath gone forth; and sinners, with songs of
salvation, are crowding to the cross!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; He bore our sins, his own self, in his own body,
<i>on the tree</i>.&nbsp; In Deut. xxi. 22, 23, we find that
death by hanging on a tree was deemed an accursed death.&nbsp;
Paul refers to this passage in the third chapter of his epistle
to the Galatians:&mdash;&ldquo;As it is written; cursed is every
one that hangeth on a tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; By consenting to
crucifixion, Christ was &ldquo;made a curse for us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What shame and ignominy did he endure in our behalf!&nbsp; See
him arrayed in royal purple, the reed of scorn in his hand, the
crown of thorns upon his head, and the cross of infamy upon his
back.&nbsp; He grows faint beneath his <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>burden.&nbsp; His murderers, fearing lest his woes
should pass endurance before their cruel thirst for his blood
could be satiated, compel Simon of Cyrene to carry one end of the
cross.&nbsp; Thus they move on to the summit of Calvary.&nbsp;
They lay the tree upon the ground, and stretch the Son of God
upon it, and nail his hands and his feet to the wood.&nbsp; It is
reared on high, with its bleeding victim; and there he hangs,
before the gazing world, and the wondering heavens; suffering the
most excruciating death ever invented, the most shameful in the
sight of man, the most accursed in the sight of God.&nbsp; All
the springs of consolation are sealed to the glorious sufferer;
and he finds not a single drop of comfort in his great
extremity.&nbsp; True, the fountains of the deep are broken up,
and the windows of heaven are opened; but not to supply him with
drink who saith&mdash;&ldquo;I thirst!&rdquo;&nbsp; From below
burst forth upon him the streams of hellish rage, a fiery deluge
from the mouth of the dragon; while from above Divine Justice
pours down a cataract of wrath, overwhelming his soul with agony,
and baptizing his body with blood.&nbsp; This is the baptism
which he anticipated in talking with his
disciples:&mdash;&ldquo;I have a baptism to be baptized with, and
how am I straitened till it be accomplished!&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us
pause a moment to contemplate this baptism.&nbsp; It was the
anguish of his soul, wringing the blood from his person, till the
crimson dew stood thick upon his brow, and rolled down in great
drops to the ground.&nbsp; The sufferings of his soul constituted
the soul of his sufferings.&nbsp; &ldquo;My soul is exceeding
sorrowful, even unto death.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not the taunt of
the rabble, the derision of the governors, nor the cruelly
lacerating scourge, that Jesus dreaded in the garden, and
deprecated in that mysterious agony.&nbsp; Nor was it the thorns,
the nails, the tree, or the spear.&nbsp; It was the burden, O
man! of thy guilt; the flaming curse of the law; the felt
displeasure of the Father against sin.&nbsp; When the martyrs
suffered death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, they rejoiced in the midst
of the fire, for the Son of man was there to sustain them; but
when Christ suffered, the Just for the unjust, he felt the
hidings of his Father&rsquo;s face, and cried after him through
the blackening heavens&mdash;&ldquo;My God! my God! why hast thou
forsaken me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Bible we read of two very remarkable trees; &ldquo;the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the midst of the
garden,&rdquo; and the tree of redemption high planted on
&ldquo;the place of skulls.&rdquo;&nbsp; Milton <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>has made
the former the theme of his majestic song, which he opens with
the following strain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of man&rsquo;s first disobedience, and the
fruit<br />
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste<br />
Brought death into the world, and all our wo,<br />
With loss of Eden, * * * * *<br />
* * * * * sing, Heavenly Muse!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let me extol that mysterious tree of life on Golgotha, by
which,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;One Greater Man<br />
Restores us, and regains the blissful seat!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sing, Heavenly Muse,&rdquo; of Jesus and his
cross!&nbsp; Sing of the wormwood and the gall, of the strife and
the triumph of Calvary!&nbsp; Let us compare these two
trees.&nbsp; By the former, &ldquo;the first Adam&rdquo;
transgressed, and entailed ruin upon his posterity; by the
latter, &ldquo;the second Adam&rdquo; &ldquo;became obedient unto
death,&rdquo; and &ldquo;brought life and immortality to
light.&rdquo;&nbsp; By a forbidden approach to the one, the chain
of the covenant was broken, Paradise forfeited, God&rsquo;s image
and favor lost, the league with hell signed, and sealed, and
ratified, and the whole earth converted into a province of the
Prince of Darkness, and delivered up to the despotism of Sin and
Death; but four thousand years afterward, the Son of God took his
stand on the other, wrestled gloriously with the tyrant usurpers,
dethroned Satan, condemned and abolished Sin, swallowed up Death
in victory, disannulled the league of earth with hell, restored
to believers the favor and image of God, reopened the gates of
the forfeited Eden to the exiles, and established a new and
everlasting covenant of grace.&nbsp; The blood of Jesus cancelled
the debt of man, and quenched the wrath of God; and from all them
that obey him, it will ultimately wash away all the stains of
sin, and all the dust of death.&nbsp; This is the newly
consecrated way into the holy of holies; this is eternal
life!&nbsp; &ldquo;Sing, Heavenly Muse,&rdquo; once more!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We too with him are dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shall with him arise:<br />
The cross on which he bows his head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall lift us to the skies!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Son of God, &ldquo;his own self, bore our sins, in
his own body, on the tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; The burden beneath which
he fainted was our burden, and would have sunk us to
perdition.&nbsp; It was for us <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>he suffered and died.&nbsp; Though
our iniquities were laid on him, they were yet our
iniquities.&nbsp; He endured the punishment in our stead.&nbsp;
He stood between us and the uplifted arm of Justice; and the
sword which would have cleft our souls asunder, was sheathed in
Emmanuel&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; His righteousness, imputed to us,
and appropriated by faith, is &ldquo;the righteousness of God,
which is unto all and upon all them that believe,&rdquo; covering
their sins, and rendering them &ldquo;accepted in the
Beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can we pass by mount Calvary, and gaze upon that wondrous
sight, and still remain unmoved?&nbsp; Have we no tears of
gratitude and love?&nbsp; Pause we not to wonder and adore?&nbsp;
O the depth of the riches! the riches of his wisdom! the riches
of his grace!</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Having thus spoken of Christ&rsquo;s vicarious
sufferings, let us notice a little more particularly the end for
which he endured them.&nbsp; &ldquo;That we, being dead to sins,
should live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were
healed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This death unto sin, and this new life unto righteousness,
denote the sanctification of the soul &ldquo;by the renewing of
the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;spiritually
minded&rdquo; man is made, through the grace of God, a
&ldquo;partaker of the Divine nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has
received a new principle, whereby his lusts and corruptions are
mortified, crucified, and slain.&nbsp; The right hand that
offended is cut off; the right eye that offended is plucked
out.&nbsp; He delights in the law of God; he feels a strong
desire, and makes strenuous efforts, to conform himself, in heart
and life, to its holy requirements.&nbsp; Made free from the
dominion and condemning power of sin, he still needs, however,
the aid of the Holy Spirit, to crucify the old man; to live
soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present evil world; to
die to sins, and live unto righteousness.&nbsp; In the court of
heaven, he is justified by the righteousness of Christ; but
before men, he is justified by his own righteousness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father who is in
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Be as a candle, not under a bushel, but on a
candlestick, enlightening all around you.&nbsp; Paul to the
Ephesians says that Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for
it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
water by the word; that he might present it to himself a glorious
church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that
it should be holy and without <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>blemish.&nbsp; God hath not called
us unto uncleanness but unto holiness.&nbsp; Let us, therefore
cleanse ourselves from all filthiness&mdash;from all manner of
pollution&mdash;of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in
the fear of God.&nbsp; For it is written, Be ye holy, for I am
holy; holy in all manner of conversation; holy in all stations,
relations, and conditions of life&mdash;as husbands and wives,
parents and children, masters and servants; and this always, and
in all places&mdash;at home and abroad, in private and in public,
in prosperity and adversity.&nbsp; Our conversation should be
such as becometh the nature and requirements of the gospel of
Christ.&nbsp; Forgetting the things that are behind, we should be
ever pressing forward towards those things that are
before&mdash;not as though we had already attained, either were
already perfect; but making perfection our mark; for we know not
yet what we shall be, but one thing we do know&mdash;that when he
shall appear, we shall be like him!&nbsp; Then, and not till
then, shall we be satisfied, when we awake in his likeness.&nbsp;
We must be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son in this
world, otherwise we cannot have the enjoyment of him in the world
to come.&nbsp; We must have the spirit of Christ, to love
righteousness, and to hate iniquity.&nbsp; We must imitate his
example in zeal and activity, doing our Father&rsquo;s work while
the day lasts.&nbsp; Die to sin, we must.&nbsp; &ldquo;For if ye
live after the flesh, ye shall die, but if ye through the spirit
do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.&nbsp;
Put off the old man with all his deceitful lusts, and put on the
new man, which, after God, is created in righteousness and true
holiness.&nbsp; Abstain from those fleshy lusts that war against
the soul; always keeping in mind, that they that are
Christ&rsquo;s have crucified the flesh, with the affections and
lusts.&nbsp; To die to sin, implies a perfect hatred of it, deep
sorrow and contrition on account of it, and a constant desire and
effort to forsake it.&nbsp; We should conscientiously use all the
means of grace, and depend entirely upon the grace of God, as
that by which alone we can obtain a victory&mdash;final and
complete,&mdash;over all our enemies, the flesh, the world, and
the devil.&nbsp; Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary,
the devil, as a roaring lion goeth about, seeking whom he may
devour.&nbsp; Good reason have you to pray without ceasing, that
you may be made strong in the Lord and in the power of his
might.&nbsp; You must put on the whole armor <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>of God,
that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the
devil.&nbsp; Your loins must be girt about with truth.&nbsp; The
breast-plate of righteousness you must wear.&nbsp; Your heart
must be protected by the shield of faith, and your feet shod with
the preparation of the gospel of peace.&nbsp; Forget not the
helmet of salvation, nor the sword of the Spirit, nor to write
often to the King&mdash;directing to the care of Jesus, that your
petitions may not fail&mdash;&ldquo;Praying always with all
prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto
with all perseverance and supplication for all
saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; As ye formerly yielded your members servants
to uncleanness, even so now yield your members servants of
righteousness unto holiness.&nbsp; Live unto righteousness.&nbsp;
Yield yourselves up unto God, as those that are alive from the
dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto
God.&nbsp; Conform to his revealed will, and keep an eye single
to his glory in the performance of every duty.</p>
<p>To produce in his people this happy change, was the end of
Messiah&rsquo;s sufferings.&nbsp; But this was not all, for the
apostle adds,&mdash;&ldquo;By whose stripes ye were
healed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Divine philosophy! supernatural science!
transcending all original conception of men and angels!&nbsp; Who
could ever have dreamed of healing by his stripes, soundness by
his wounds, pleasure by his pains, and life eternal by his
death!&nbsp; We are afflicted by the old inveterate plague of
sin, but there is balm in Gilead, and a Physician there.&nbsp;
His blood alone can cure the malady, and that is
infallible.&nbsp; All the way from Bethlehem to Calvary, he was
employed in preparing his materia medica.&nbsp; The Gospel is the
great store-house of this precious preparation.&nbsp; It is
always full; it is always free; and the sign over its entrance
is&mdash;&ldquo;Able to save to the uttermost.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Holy Spirit is continually making the application, and all who
come are cured.</p>
<p>It is a matter of all others the most momentous, that we know
our personal interest in these things.&nbsp; If we be not dead to
sins, and alive unto righteousness&mdash;if we be not healed by
the stripes of Jesus&mdash;his sufferings upon the cross, and our
theoretical faith in their vicarious character and saving power,
will profit us nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man have not the
spirit of Christ, he is none of his.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a vast
difference between sanctification and morality.&nbsp; A man may
perform many excellent deeds, while the principle that <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>actuates
him is averse to true godliness.&nbsp; Happy are they, whose sins
are pardoned, whose persons are justified, and whose bodies are
become temples of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The Lord is their God and
Father.&nbsp; They have passed from death unto life, and shall
not come into condemnation.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is now no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit; for the law of the Spirit of
life, in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sin and
death.&rdquo;</p>

164</span>SERMON IX.<br />
THE PURIFICATION OF CONSCIENCE.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>How much more shall the blood of
Christ</i>, <i>who</i>, <i>through the eternal Spirit</i>,
<i>offered himself without spot to God</i>, <i>purge your
conscience from dead works to serve the living
God</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. ix. 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hebrew Christians, to whom the
apostle wrote, were well acquainted with the laws of ceremonial
purification by the blood of beasts and birds, for by blood
almost every thing was purified in the service of the
temple.&nbsp; But it is only the blood of Christ that can purge
the human conscience.&nbsp; In speaking of this purification, as
presented in our text, let us notice&mdash;<i>the object</i>,
<i>the means</i>, and <i>the end</i>.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The object of this purification is the conscience;
which all the sacrificial blood shed, from the gate of Eden, down
to the extinction of the fire on the Jewish altar, was not
sufficient to purge.</p>
<p><i>What is the conscience</i>?&nbsp; An inferior judge, the
representative of Jehovah, holding his court in the human soul;
according to whose decision we feel either confidence and joy in
God, or condemnation and tormenting fear.&nbsp; His judicial
power is graduated by the degree of moral and evangelical light
which has been shed upon his palace.&nbsp; His knowledge of the
will and the character of God is the law by which he justifies or
condemns.&nbsp; His intelligence is the measure of his authority;
and the perfection of knowledge would be the infallibility of
conscience.</p>
<p>This faithful recorder and deputy judge is with us through all
the journey of life, and will accompany us with his register over
the river Jordan, whether to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom or the society
of the <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>rich men in hell.&nbsp; While conscience keeps a record
on earth, Jehovah keeps a record in heaven; and when both books
shall be opened in the final judgment, there shall be found a
perfect correspondence.&nbsp; When temptations are presented, the
understanding opposes them, but the carnal mind indulges them,
and there is a contest between the judgment and the will, and we
hesitate which to obey, till the warning bell of conscience rings
through the soul, and gives distinct notice of his awful
recognition; and when we turn away recklessly from his faithful
admonitions, we hear low mutterings of wrath stealing along the
avenues, and the quick sound of writing-pens in the recording
office, causing every denizen of the mental palace to
tremble.</p>
<p>There is <i>a good conscience</i>, <i>and an evil
conscience</i>.&nbsp; The work of both, however, is the same;
consisting in keeping a true record of the actions of men, and
passing sentence upon them according to their deserts.&nbsp;
Conscience is called good or evil only with reference to the
character of its record and its sentence.&nbsp; If the record is
one of virtues, and the sentence one of approval, the conscience
is good; if the record is one of vices, and the sentence one of
condemnation, the conscience is evil.</p>
<p>Some have a <i>guilty conscience</i>; that is, a conscience
that holds up to their view a black catalogue of crimes, and
rings in their ears the sentence of condemnation.&nbsp; If you
have such a conscience, you are invited to Jesus, that you may
find peace to your souls.&nbsp; He is ever in his office,
receiving all who come, and blotting out with his own blood the
handwriting which is against them.</p>
<p>But some have a <i>despairing conscience</i>.&nbsp; They think
that their crimes are too great to be forgiven.&nbsp; The
registry of guilt, and the decree of death, hide from their eyes
the mercy of God, and the merit of Christ.&nbsp; Their sins rise
like mountains between them and heaven.&nbsp; But let them look
away to Calvary.&nbsp; If their sins are a thousand times more
numerous than their tears, the blood of Jesus is ten thousand
times more powerful than their sins.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is able to
save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him, seeing he
ever liveth to make intercession for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And others have a <i>dark and hardened conscience</i>.&nbsp;
They are so deceived, that they &ldquo;cry peace and safety, when
destruction is at the door.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are &ldquo;past
feeling, having the conscience seared as with a hot
iron.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have sold themselves to work evil; to <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>eat sin
like bread, and drink iniquity like water.&nbsp; They have bribed
or gagged the recorder and accuser within them.&nbsp; They will
betray the just cause of the righteous, and slay the messengers
of salvation, and think that they are doing God service.&nbsp;
John the Baptist is beheaded, that Herod may keep his oath of
honor.&nbsp; A dead fish cannot swim against the stream; but if
the king&rsquo;s conscience had been alive and faithful, he would
have said:&mdash;&ldquo;Girl, I promised to give thee thy
request, even to the half of my kingdom; but thou hast requested
too much; for the head of Messiah&rsquo;s herald is more valuable
than my whole kingdom, and all the kingdoms of the
world!&rdquo;&nbsp; But he had not the fear of God before his
eyes, and the proud fool sent and beheaded the prophet in his
cell.</p>
<p>A <i>good conscience</i> is a faithful conscience, a lively
conscience, a peaceful conscience, a conscience void of offence
toward God and man, resting in the shadow of the cross, and
assured of an interest in its infinite merit.&nbsp; It is the
victory of faith unfeigned, working by love, and purifying the
heart.&nbsp; It is always found in the neighborhood and society
of its brethren; &ldquo;a broken heart, and a contrite
spirit;&rdquo; an intense hatred of sin, and an ardent love of
holiness; a spirit of fervent prayer and supplication, and a life
of scrupulous integrity and charity; and above all, an humble
confidence in the mercy of God, through the mediation of
Christ.&nbsp; These constitute the brotherhood of Christianity;
and wherever they abound, a good conscience is never
lacking.&nbsp; They are its very element and life; its food, its
sunshine, and its vital air.</p>
<p>Conscience was a faithful recorder and judge under the law;
and notwithstanding the revolution which has taken place,
introducing a new constitution, and a new administration,
Conscience still retains his office; and when &ldquo;purged from
dead works to serve the living God,&rdquo; is appropriately
called a <i>good conscience</i>.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The means of this purification is &ldquo;the blood
of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without
spot to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could we take in, at a single view, all the bearings of
&ldquo;the blood of Christ,&rdquo; as exhibited in the gospel,
what an astonishing light would it cast upon the condition of
man; the character of God; the nature and requirements of his
law; the dreadful consequences of sin; the wondrous expiation of
the cross; the reconciliation of Heaven and earth; the blessed
union of the believer with God in Christ, as a just God and a
Savior; and the whole <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>scheme of our justification,
sanctification, and redemption, through free, sovereign,
infinite, and unspeakable grace!</p>
<p>There is no knowledge like the knowledge of Christ, for the
excellency of which the apostle counted all things but
loss.&nbsp; Christ is the Sun of Righteousness, in whose light we
see the tops of the mountains of immortality, towering above the
dense clouds which overhang the valley of death.&nbsp; All the
wisdom which philosophers have learned from nature and
providence, compared with that which is afforded by the Christian
Revelation, is like the ignis fatuus compared with the sun.&nbsp;
The knowledge of Plato, and Socrates, and all the renowned sages
of antiquity, was nothing to the knowledge of the feeblest
believer in &ldquo;the blood of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blood of Christ&rdquo; is of infinite value.&nbsp;
There is none like it flowing in human veins.&nbsp; It was the
blood of a man, but of a man who knew no iniquity; the blood of a
sinless humanity, in which dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead
bodily; the blood of the second Adam, who is the Lord from
heaven, and a quickening spirit upon earth.&nbsp; It pressed
through every pore of his body in the garden; and gushed from his
head, his hands, his feet, and his side, upon the cross.&nbsp; I
approach with fear and trembling, yet with humble confidence and
joy.&nbsp; I take off my shoes, like Moses, as he draws near the
burning bush; for I hear a voice coming forth from the altar,
saying&mdash;&ldquo;I and my Father are one; I am the true God,
and eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression, &ldquo;the blood of Christ,&rdquo; includes
the whole of his obedience to the moral law, by the imputation of
which we are justified; and all the sufferings of his soul and
his body as our Mediator, by which an atonement is made for our
sins, and a fountain opened to wash them all away.&nbsp; This is
the spring whence rise the rivers of forgiving and sanctifying
grace.</p>
<p>In the representation which the text gives us of this
redeeming blood, are several points worthy of our special
consideration:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; It is <i>the blood of Christ</i>; the appointed
Substitute and Saviour of men; &ldquo;the Lamb of God, that
taketh away the sins of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, <i>who offered
himself</i>.&nbsp; His humanity was the only sacrifice which
would answer the demands of justice, and atone for the
transgressions of mankind.&nbsp; Therefore &ldquo;he made his
soul an offering for sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>3.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, who offered himself
<i>to God</i>.&nbsp; It was the eternal Father, whose broken law
must be repaired, whose dishonored government must be vindicated,
and whose flaming indignation must be turned away.&nbsp; The well
beloved Son must meet the Father&rsquo;s frown, and bear the
Father&rsquo;s curse for us.&nbsp; All the Divine attributes
called for the offering; and without it, could not be reconciled
to the sinner.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, who offered himself to
God, <i>without spot</i>.&nbsp; This was a perfect
sacrifice.&nbsp; The victim was without blemish or defect; the
altar was complete in all its appurtenances; and the high-priest
possessed every conceivable qualification for his work.&nbsp;
Christ was at once victim, altar, and high-priest; &ldquo;holy,
harmless, and undefiled;&rdquo; &ldquo;God manifest in the
flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being himself perfect God, and perfect man,
and perfect Mediator between God and man, he perfects for ever
all them that believe.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, who offered himself to
God, without spot, <i>through the eternal Spirit</i>.&nbsp; By
the eternal Spirit here, we are to understand, not the third
person of the Godhead, but the second; Christ&rsquo;s own Divine
nature, which was co-eternal with the Father before the world
was; and which, in the fulness of time, seized on humanity,
sinless and immaculate humanity, and offered it body and soul, as
a sacrifice for human sins.&nbsp; The eternal Spirit was at once
the priest that offered the victim, and the altar that sanctified
the offering.&nbsp; Without this agency, there could have been no
atonement.&nbsp; The offering of mere humanity, however spotless,
aside from the merit derived from its connection with Divinity,
could not have been a sacrifice of sweet-smelling savor unto
God.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; It is the blood of Christ, who offered himself to
God, without spot, through the eternal Spirit, <i>that he might
purge your conscience</i>.&nbsp; As the typical sacrifices under
the law purified men from ceremonial defilement, so the real
sacrifice of the Gospel saves the believer from moral
pollution.&nbsp; Blood was the life of all the services of the
tabernacle made with hands, and gave significance and utility to
all the rites of the former dispensation.&nbsp; By blood the
covenant between God and his people was sealed.&nbsp; By blood
the officers and vessels of the sanctuary were consecrated.&nbsp;
By blood the children of Israel were preserved in Egypt from the
destroying angel.&nbsp; So the blood of Christ is our
justification, sanctification, and redemption.&nbsp; All the
blessings of the gospel flow to us through the blood <a

Lamb.&nbsp; Mercy, when she writes our pardon, and when she
registers our names in &ldquo;the Book of Life,&rdquo; dips her
pen in the blood of the Lamb.&nbsp; And the vast company that
John saw before the throne had come out of great tribulation,
having &ldquo;washed their robes and made them white in the blood
of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children of Israel were delivered from Egypt, on the very
night that the paschal lamb was slain, and its blood sprinkled
upon the doorposts, as if their liberty and life were procured by
its death.&nbsp; This typified the necessity and power of the
atonement, which is the very heart of the gospel, and the
spiritual life of the believer.&nbsp; In Egypt, however, there
was a lamb slain for every family; but under the new covenant God
has but one family, and one Lamb is sufficient for their
salvation.</p>
<p>In the cleansing of the leper, several things were necessary;
as running water, cedar wood, scarlet and hyssop, and the finger
of the priest; but it was the blood that gave efficacy to the
whole.&nbsp; So it is in the purification of the
conscience.&nbsp; Without the shedding of blood, the leper could
not be cleansed; without the shedding of blood, the conscience
cannot be purged.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blood of Christ&rdquo; seals
every precept, every promise, every warning, of the New
Testament.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blood of Christ&rdquo; renders the
Scriptures &ldquo;profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The blood of Christ&rdquo; gives efficiency to the pulpit;
and when &ldquo;Jesus Christ and him crucified&rdquo; is shut
out, the virtue is wanting which heals and restores the
soul.&nbsp; It is only through the crucifixion of Christ, that
&ldquo;the old man&rdquo; is crucified in the believer.&nbsp; It
is only through his obedience unto death, even the death of the
cross, that our dead souls are quickened, to serve God in newness
of life.</p>
<p>Here rest our hopes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The foundation of God
standeth sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bill of redemption being
presented by Christ, was read by the prophets, and passed
unanimously in both houses of parliament.&nbsp; It had its final
reading in the lower house, when Messiah hung on Calvary; and
passed three days afterward, when he rose from the dead.&nbsp; It
was introduced to the upper house by the Son of God himself, who
appeared before the throne &ldquo;as a lamb newly slain,&rdquo;
and was carried by acclamation of the heavenly hosts.&nbsp; Then
it became a law of the kingdom of heaven, and the Holy Ghost was
sent down to establish it in the hearts of men.&nbsp; It is
&ldquo;the perfect <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>law of liberty,&rdquo; by which God is reconciling the
world unto himself.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;the law of the Spirit of
Life,&rdquo; by which he is &ldquo;purging our conscience from
dead works to serve the living God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; The end of this purification is twofold:&mdash;that
we may cease from dead works, and serve the living God.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The works of unrenewed souls are all &ldquo;dead
works,&rdquo; can be no other than &ldquo;dead works,&rdquo;
because the agents are &ldquo;dead in trespasses and
sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; They proceed from &ldquo;the carnal
mind,&rdquo; which &ldquo;is enmity against God,&rdquo; which
&ldquo;is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; How can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,
or a corrupt fountain send forth pure water?</p>
<p>But the blood of Christ is intended to &ldquo;purge the
conscience from dead works.&rdquo;&nbsp; The apostle
says&mdash;&ldquo;Ye are not redeemed with corruptible things, as
silver and gold, from your vain conversation, received by
tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of
Christ, as of a lamb without blemish, and without
spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Jews were in a state of bondage to the
ceremonial law, toiling at the &ldquo;dead works,&rdquo; the vain
and empty forms, which could never take away sin; and unjustified
and unregenerate men are still captives of Satan, slaves of sin
and death, tyrannized over by various evil habits and
propensities, which are invincible to all things but &ldquo;the
blood of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died to redeem, both from the
burdens of the Mosaic ritual, and from the despotism of moral
evil&mdash;to purge the conscience of both Jew and Gentile
&ldquo;from dead works, to serve the living God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We cannot &ldquo;serve the living God,&rdquo; without
this preparatory purification of conscience.&nbsp; If our guilt
is uncancelled&mdash;if the love of sin is not
dethroned&mdash;the service of the knee and the lip is nothing
but hypocrisy.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we regard iniquity in our hearts,
the Lord will not hear us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cherishing what he hates,
all our offerings are an abomination to him; and we can no more
stand in his holy presence than the dry stubble can stand before
a flaming fire.&nbsp; He who has an evil conscience, flees from
the face of God, as did Adam in the garden.&nbsp; Nothing but
&ldquo;the blood of Christ,&rdquo; applied by the Holy Spirit,
can remove the sinner&rsquo;s guilty fear, and enable him to draw
nigh to God in the humble confidence of acceptance through the
Beloved.</p>
<p>The service of the living God must flow from a new principle
of life in the soul.&nbsp; The Divine word must be the rule of
our actions.&nbsp; <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>The Divine will must be consulted and obeyed.&nbsp; We
must remember that God is holy, and jealous of his honor.&nbsp;
The consideration that he is everywhere, and sees every thing,
and will bring every work into judgment, must fill us with
reverence and godly fear.&nbsp; An ardent love for his law and
his character must supplant the love of sin, and prompt to a
cheerful and impartial obedience.</p>
<p>And let us remember that he is &ldquo;the <i>living</i>
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pharaoh is dead, Herod is dead, Nero is dead;
but Jehovah is &ldquo;the living God,&rdquo; and it is a fearful
thing to have him for an enemy.&nbsp; Death cannot deliver from
his hand.&nbsp; Time, and even eternity, cannot limit his holy
anger.&nbsp; He has manifested, in a thousand instances, his
hatred of sin; in the destruction of the old world, the burning
of Sodom and Gomorrah, the drowning of Pharaoh and his host in
the sea; and I tell thee, sinner, except thou repent, thou shalt
likewise perish!&nbsp; O, think what punishment &ldquo;the living
God&rdquo; can inflict upon his adversaries&mdash;the loss of all
good&mdash;the endurance of all evil&mdash;the undying
worm&mdash;the unquenchable fire&mdash;the blackness of darkness
for ever!</p>
<p>The gods of the heathen have no life in them, and they who
worship them are like unto them.&nbsp; But our God is &ldquo;the
living God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the God of the living.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If you are united to him by faith in &ldquo;the blood of
Christ,&rdquo; your souls are &ldquo;quickened together with
him,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the power which raised him from the dead
shall also quicken your mortal body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May the Lord awaken those who are dead in trespasses and sins,
and revive his work in the midst of the years, and strengthen the
feeble graces of his people, and bless abundantly the labors of
his servants, so that many consciences may be purged from dead
works to serve the living God!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a fountain filled with blood,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawn from Emmanuel&rsquo;s veins,<br />
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lose all their guilty stains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dying thief rejoiced to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fountain in his day;<br />
And there may I, as vile as he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash all my sins away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear dying Lamb! thy precious blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall never lose its power,<br />
Till all the ransomed sons of God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are saved to sin no more!&rdquo;</p>

THE CEDAR OF GOD.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Thus saith the Lord God</i>; <i>I will
also take of the highest branch of the high cedar</i>, <i>and
will set it</i>; <i>I will crop off from the top of his young
twigs a tender one</i>, <i>and plant it upon a high mountain and
eminent</i>; <i>in the mountain of the height of Israel will I
plant it</i>; <i>and it shall bring forth boughs</i>, <i>and bear
fruit</i>, <i>and be a goodly cedar</i>; <i>and under it shall
dwell all fowl of every wing</i>; <i>in the shadow of the
branches thereof shall they dwell</i>; <i>and all the trees of
the field shall know that I</i>, <i>the Lord</i>, <i>have brought
down the high tree</i>, <i>and have exalted the low
tree</i>&mdash;<i>have dried up the green tree</i>, <i>and have
made the dry tree to flourish</i>.&nbsp; <i>I</i>, <i>the
Lord</i>, <i>have spoken</i>, <i>and I have done
it</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Ezek. xvii. 22&ndash;24.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> perceive that our text abounds
in the beautiful language of allegory.&nbsp; In the context is
portrayed the captivity of the children of Israel, and especially
the carrying away of the royal family, by the king of
Babylon.&nbsp; Here God promises to restore them to their own
land, in greater prosperity than ever; and to raise up Messiah,
the Branch, out of the house of David, to be their king.&nbsp;
All this is presented in a glowing figurative style, dressed out
in all the wealth of poetic imagery, so peculiar to the
orientals.&nbsp; Nebuchadnezzar, the great eagle&mdash;the
long-winged, full-feathered, embroidered eagle&mdash;is
represented as coming to Lebanon, and taking the highest branch
of the tallest cedar, bearing it off as the crow bears the acorn
in its beak, and planting it in the land of traffic.&nbsp; The
Lord God, in his turn, takes the highest branch of the same
cedar, and plants it on the high mountain of Israel, where it
flourishes and bears fruit, and the fowls of the air dwell under
the shadow of its branches.</p>
<p>We will make a few general remarks on the character of the
promise, and then pass to a more particular consideration of its
import.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; This is an <i>evangelical</i> promise.&nbsp; It
relates to the coming and <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>kingdom of Messiah.&nbsp; Not one of
the kings of Judah since the captivity, as Boothroyd well
observes, answers to the description here given.&nbsp; Not one of
them was a cedar whose branches could afford shadow and shelter
for all the fowls of heaven.&nbsp; But the prophecy receives its
fulfilment in Christ, the desire of all nations, to whom the ends
of the earth shall come for salvation.</p>
<p>This prophecy bears a striking resemblance in several
particulars, to the parable of the mustard-seed, delivered by our
Lord.&nbsp; The mustard-seed, said Jesus, &ldquo;is the least of
all seeds; but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs,
and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge
in the branches thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the delicate twig of the
young and tender branch becomes a goodly cedar, and under its
shadow dwell all fowl of every wing.&nbsp; The prophecy and the
parable are alike intended to represent the growth and prosperity
of Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom, and the gracious protection and
spiritual refreshment afforded to its subjects.&nbsp; Christ is
the mustard plant, and cedar of God; and to him shall the
gathering of the people be; and multitudes of pardoned sinners
shall sit under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit
shall be sweet to their taste.</p>
<p>This prophecy is a promise of the true, and faithful, and
immutable God.&nbsp; It begins with&mdash;&ldquo;Thus saith the
Lord God, I will do thus and so;&rdquo; and concludes
with&mdash;&ldquo;I, the Lord, have spoken, and I have done
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no peradventure with God.&nbsp; His
word is for ever settled in heaven, and cannot fail of its
fulfilment.&nbsp; When he says&mdash;&ldquo;I promise to
pay,&rdquo; there is no failure, whatever the sum.&nbsp; The bank
of heaven cannot break.&nbsp; It is the oldest and best in the
universe.&nbsp; Its capital is infinite; its credit is
infallible.&nbsp; The mighty God, the everlasting Father, the
Prince of Peace, is able to fulfil to the utmost all his
engagements.&nbsp; He can do any thing that does not imply a
contradiction, or a moral absurdity.&nbsp; He could take upon
himself the form of a servant, and become obedient unto death,
even the death of the cross; but he can never forget or disregard
his promise, any more than he can cease to exist.&nbsp; His
nature renders both impossible.&nbsp; Heaven and earth shall pass
away, but his word shall not pass away.&nbsp; Every jot and
tittle shall be fulfilled.&nbsp; This is the consolation of the
church.&nbsp; Here rested the patriarchs and the prophets.&nbsp;
Here reposes the faith of the saints to the end of time.&nbsp;
God abideth faithful; he <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>cannot deny himself.&nbsp; Our text
is already partially verified in the advent of Christ, and the
establishment of his church; the continuous growth of the gospel
kingdom indicates its progressive fulfilment; and we anticipate
the time, as not far distant, when the whole earth shall be
overshadowed by the branches of the cedar of God.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; We proceed to consider, with a little more
particularity, the import of this evangelical prophecy.&nbsp; It
describes the character and mediatorial kingdom of Christ, and
the blessings which he confers upon his people.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; His character and mediatorial kingdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set
it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one,
and plant it upon a high mountain and eminent; in the mountain of
the height of Israel will I plant it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ, as concerning the flesh, is of the seed of
Abraham&mdash;a rod issuing from the stem of Jesse, and a branch
growing out of his root.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the new vine is found in
the cluster, and one saith, destroy it not, for a blessing is in
it;&rdquo; so the children of Israel were spared, notwithstanding
their perverseness and their backslidings, because they were the
cluster from which should be expressed in due time the new wine
of the kingdom&mdash;because from them was to come forth the
blessing, the promised seed in whom all the families of the earth
shall be blessed.&nbsp; The Word that was in the beginning with
God, one with God in essence and in attributes, in the fulness of
time assumed our nature, and tabernacled and dwelt among
us.&nbsp; Here is the union of God and man.&nbsp; Here is the
great mystery of godliness&mdash;God manifest in the flesh.&nbsp;
But I have only time now to take off my shoes, and draw near the
burning bush, and gaze a moment upon this great sight.</p>
<p>The Father is represented as preparing a body for his
Son.&nbsp; He goes to the quarry to seek a stone, a foundation
stone for Zion.&nbsp; The angel said to Mary:&mdash;&ldquo;The
Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest
shall overshadow thee; therefore that Holy Thing which shall be
born of thee shall be called the Son of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
eternal lays hold on that nature which is hastening downward, on
the flood of sin, to the gulf of death and destruction, and binds
it to himself.&nbsp; Though made in the likeness of sinful flesh,
he was holy, harmless, and undefiled.&nbsp; He did no <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>iniquity,
neither was guile found in his mouth.&nbsp; The rod out of the
stem of Jesse is also Jehovah our righteousness.&nbsp; The child
born in Bethlehem is the mighty God.&nbsp; The Son given to
Israel is the everlasting Father.&nbsp; He is of the seed of
Abraham, according to the flesh; but he is also the true God and
eternal life.&nbsp; Two natures and three offices meet
mysteriously in his person.&nbsp; He is at once the bleeding
sacrifice, the sanctifying altar, the officiating priest, the
prophet of Israel, and the Prince of Peace.&nbsp; All this was
necessary, that he might become &ldquo;the author of eternal
salvation to all them that obey him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hear Jehovah speaking of Messiah and his
kingdom:&mdash;&ldquo;Why do the heathen rage, and the people
imagine a vain thing?&nbsp; The kings of the earth set
themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against the
Lord, and against his anointed.&nbsp; Yet have I set my king upon
my holy hill of Zion.&nbsp; I will declare the decree by which he
is to rule his redeemed empire.&rdquo;&nbsp; That decree, long
kept secret, was gradually announced by the prophets; but at the
new tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, Jehovah himself proclaimed it
aloud, to the astonishment of earth, the terror of hell, and the
joy of heaven:&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art my Son; this day have I
begotten thee.&nbsp; Come forth from the womb of the grave, thou
whose goings forth have been from of old, even from
everlasting.&nbsp; Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen
for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
thy possession.&nbsp; I will exalt thee to the throne of the
universe, and thou shalt be chief in the chariot of the
gospel.&nbsp; Thou shalt ride through the dark places of the
earth, with the lamps of eternal life suspended to thy chariot,
enlightening the world.&nbsp; Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings;
be instructed ye judges of the earth.&nbsp; Serve the Lord with
fear, and rejoice with trembling.&nbsp; Kiss the Son, lest he be
angry, and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a
little.&nbsp; Let no man withstand him.&nbsp; Let no man seek to
stay his progress.&nbsp; Herod, Pilate, Caiaphas, stand off!
clear the way! lest ye be crushed beneath the wheels of his
chariot! for that which is a savor of life to some, is to others
a savor of death; and if this stone shall fall upon you, it shall
grind you to powder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behold, here is wisdom!&nbsp; All other mysteries are toys in
comparison with the mystery of the everlasting gospel&mdash;the
union of three persons in the Godhead&mdash;the union of two
natures in the <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>Mediator&mdash;the union of believers to Christ, as the
branches to the vine&mdash;the union of all the saints together
in him, who is the head of the body, and the chief stone of the
corner&mdash;the mighty God transfixed to the cross&mdash;the son
of Mary ruling in the heaven of heavens&mdash;the rod of Jesse
becoming the sceptre of universal dominion&mdash;the Branch
growing out of his root, the little delicate branch which a lamb
might crop for its food, terrifying and taming the serpent, the
lion, the leopard, the tiger, and the wolf, and transforming into
gentleness and love the wild and savage nature of all the beasts
of prey upon the mountain!&nbsp; &ldquo;And such,&rdquo; old
Corinthian sinners, &ldquo;were some of you; but ye are washed,
ye are sanctified, ye are justified, in the name of the Lord
Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And such, my
brethren, were some of you; but ye have been made a new creation
in Christ Jesus; old things are passed away, and all things are
become new.&nbsp; Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ
in God.&nbsp; He is one with the Father, and ye are one in him;
united and interwoven, like the roots of the trees in the forest
of Lebanon; so that none can injure the least disciple of Christ,
without touching the apple of his eye, and grieving all his
members.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The blessings which he confers upon his people.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a
goodly cedar, and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in
the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell; and all the
trees of the field shall know that I, the Lord, have brought down
the high tree, and have exalted the low tree&mdash;have dried up
the green tree, and have made the dry tree to
flourish.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Christ is a fruitful tree</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The tree is
known by his fruit.&nbsp; Men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor
figs of thistles.&nbsp; Every good tree bringeth forth good
fruit, and every evil tree bringeth forth evil
fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a singular, supernatural tree.&nbsp;
Though its top reaches to the heaven of heavens, its branches
fill the universe, and bend down to the earth, laden with the
precious fruits of pardon, and holiness, and eternal life.&nbsp;
On the day of Pentecost, we see them hang so low over Jerusalem,
that the very murderers of the Son of God reach and pluck and
eat, and three thousand sinners feast on more than angels&rsquo;
food.&nbsp; That was the feast of first-fruits.&nbsp; Never
before was there such a harvest and such a festival.&nbsp; Angels
know nothing of the delicious fruits of the tree of
redemption.&nbsp; <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>They know nothing of the joy of pardon, and the spirit
of adoption.&nbsp; The bride of the Lamb alone can
say:&mdash;&ldquo;As the apple tree among the trees of the
forest, so is my beloved among the sons.&nbsp; I sat down under
his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my
taste.&nbsp; He brought me also to his banqueting house, and his
banner over me was love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These blessings are the precious effects of Christ&rsquo;s
mediatorial work; flowing down to all believers, like streams of
living water.&nbsp; Come, ye famishing souls, and take, without
money and without price.&nbsp; All things are now ready.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all
manner of pleasant fruits, both new and old.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is
no scarcity.&nbsp; Our Elder Brother keeps a rich table in our
Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Hear him proclaiming in the streets
of the city, in the chief places of concourse:&mdash;&ldquo;Come
to the festival.&nbsp; There is bread enough, and to spare.&nbsp;
My oxen and my fatlings are killed.&nbsp; My board is spread with
the most exquisite delicacies&mdash;wine on the lees well
refined, and fruits such as angels never tasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Christ is a tree of protection to his people</i>.&nbsp;
This cedar not only beautifies the forest, but also affords shade
and shelter for the fowls of the air.&nbsp; We have the same idea
in the parable of the mustard seed:&mdash;&ldquo;the birds of the
air came and lodged in the branches thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
the fulfilment of the promise concerning the
Shiloh:&mdash;&ldquo;to him shall the gathering of the people
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the drawing of sinners to Christ; and the
union of believers with God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All fowl of every wing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sinners of every
age and every degree&mdash;sinners of all languages, colors, and
climes&mdash;sinners of all principles, customs, and
habits&mdash;sinners whose crimes are of the blackest
hue&mdash;sinners carrying about them the savor of the brimstone
of hell&mdash;sinners deserving eternal damnation&mdash;sinners
perishing for lack of knowledge&mdash;sinners pierced by the
arrows of conviction&mdash;sinners ready to sink under the burden
of sin&mdash;sinners overwhelmed with terror and
despair&mdash;are seen flying to Christ as a cloud, and as doves
to their windows&mdash;moving to the ark of mercy before the door
is shut&mdash;seeking rest in the shadow of this goodly
cedar!</p>
<p>Christ is the sure defence of his church.&nbsp; A thousand
times has she been assailed by her enemies.&nbsp; The princes of
the earth have set themselves in array against her, and hell has
opened upon her <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>all its batteries.&nbsp; But the Rock of Ages has ever
been her strong fortress and high tower.&nbsp; He will never
refuse to shelter her from her adversaries.&nbsp; In the time of
trouble, he shall hide her in his pavilion; in the secret of his
tabernacle shall he hide her.&nbsp; When the heavens are dark and
angry, she flies, like the affrighted dove, to the thick branches
of the &ldquo;Goodly Cedar.&rdquo;&nbsp; There she is safe from
the windy storm and tempest.&nbsp; There she may rest in
confidence, till these calamities be overpast.&nbsp; The tree of
her protection can never be riven by the lightning, nor broken by
the blast.</p>
<p><i>Christ is the source of life and beauty to all the trees in
the garden of God</i>.&nbsp; Jehovah determined to teach
&ldquo;the trees of the forest&rdquo; a new lesson.&nbsp; Let the
princes of this world hear it, and the proud philosophers of
Greece and Rome.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have brought down the high tree,
and exalted the low tree&mdash;have dried up the green tree, and
made the dry tree to flourish.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many things have
occurred, in the providence of God, which might illustrate these
metaphors; such as the bringing of Pharaoh down to the bottom of
the sea, that Israel might be exalted to sing the song of Moses;
and the drying up of the pride and pomp of Haman, that Mordecai
might flourish in honor and esteem.&nbsp; But for the most
transcendent accomplishment of the prophecy, we must go to
Calvary.&nbsp; There is the high tree brought down to the dust of
death, that the low tree might be exalted to life eternal; the
green tree dried up by the fires of Divine wrath, that the dry
tree might flourish in the favor of God for ever.</p>
<p>To this, particularly, our blessed Redeemer seems to refer, in
his address to the daughters of Jerusalem, as they follow him,
weeping, to the place of crucifixion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Weep not for
me,&rdquo; saith he.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a mystery in all this,
which you cannot now comprehend.&nbsp; Like Joseph, I have been
sold by my brethren; but like Joseph, I will be a blessing to all
my Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I am carrying this cross to
Calvary that I may be crucified upon it between two thieves; but
when the lid of the mystical ark shall be lifted, then shall ye
see that it is to save sinners I give my back to the smiters, and
my life for a sacrifice.&nbsp; Weep not for me, but for
yourselves and your children; for if they do these things in the
green tree, what shall be done in the dry?&nbsp; I am the green
tree to-day; and behold, I am consumed that you may
flourish.&nbsp; I am the high tree, and am prostrated that you
may be exalted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>The
fire-brands of Jerusalem had wellnigh kindled to a flame of
themselves, amid the tumult of the people, when they cried
out&mdash;&ldquo;Away with him!&nbsp; Crucify him!&nbsp; His
blood be on us, and on our children!&rdquo;&nbsp; O wonder of
mercy! that they were not seized and consumed at once by fire
from heaven!&nbsp; But he whom they crucify prays for them, and
they are spared.&nbsp; Hear his
intercession:&mdash;&ldquo;Father, forgive them!&nbsp; Save these
sinners, ready for the fire.&nbsp; On me, on me alone, be the
fierceness of thy indignation.&nbsp; I am ready to drink the cup
which thou hast mingled.&nbsp; I am willing to fall beneath the
stroke of thy angry justice.&nbsp; I come to suffer for the
guilty.&nbsp; Bind me in their stead, lay me upon the altar, and
send down fire to consume the sacrifice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was done.&nbsp; I heard a great voice from
heaven:&mdash;&ldquo;Awake, O sword, against my shepherd!&nbsp;
Kindle the flame!&nbsp; Let off the artillery!&rdquo;&nbsp; Night
suddenly enveloped the earth.&nbsp; Nature trembled around
me.&nbsp; I heard the rending of the rocks.&nbsp; I looked, and
lo! the stroke had fallen upon the high tree, and the green tree
was all on fire!&nbsp; While I gazed, I heard a voice, mournful,
but strangely sweet:&mdash;&ldquo;My God! my God! why hast thou
forsaken me?&nbsp; My heart is like wax; it is melted in the
midst of my bowels.&nbsp; My strength is dried up like a
potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws.&nbsp; One may tell
all my bones.&nbsp; Dogs have compassed me about; strong bulls of
Bashan have beset me.&nbsp; They stare at me; they gape upon me
with their mouths; they pierce my hands and my feet.&nbsp;
Deliver my soul from the lions; my darling from the power of the
dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; O with what majestic
sweetness fell that voice upon my soul!&nbsp; Instantly the
clouds were scattered.&nbsp; I looked, and saw, with unspeakable
wonder, millions of the low trees shooting up, and millions of
the dry trees putting forth leaves and fruit.&nbsp; Then I took
my harp, and sang this song:&mdash;&ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb! for
he was humbled that we might be exalted; he was wounded that we
might be healed; he was robbed that we might be enriched; he was
slain that we might live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saw the beam of a great scale; one end descending to
the abyss, borne down by the power of the atonement; the other
ascending to the heaven of heavens, and lifting up the prisoners
of the tomb.&nbsp; Wonderful scheme!&nbsp; Christ condemned for
our justification; forsaken of his Father, that we might enjoy
his fellowship; <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>passing under the curse of the law, to bear it away
from the believer forever!&nbsp; This is the great scale of
redemption.&nbsp; As one end of the beam falls under the load of
our sins, which were laid on Christ; the other rises, bearing the
basket of mercy, full of pardons, and blessings, and hopes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He who knew no sin was made sin for us&rdquo;&mdash;that
is his end of the beam; &ldquo;that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him&rdquo;&mdash;this is ours.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became
poor&rdquo;&mdash;there goes his end down; &ldquo;that we,
through his poverty, might be rich&rdquo;&mdash;here comes ours
up.</p>
<p>O sinners! ye withered and fallen trees, fuel for the
everlasting burning, ready to ignite at the first spark of
vengeance!&nbsp; O ye faithless souls! self-ruined and
self-condemned! enemies in your hearts by wicked works! we pray
you in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye reconciled to God!&nbsp; He
has found out a plan for your salvation&mdash;to raise up the low
tree by humbling the high, and save the dry tree from the fire by
burning up the green.&nbsp; He is able to put, at the same time,
a crown of glory on the head of the law, and a crown of mercy on
the head of the sinner.&nbsp; One of those hands which were
nailed to the cross blotted out the fiery handwriting of Sinai,
while the other opened the prison-doors of the captives.&nbsp;
From the mysterious depths of Messiah&rsquo;s sufferings flows
the river of the water of life.&nbsp; Eternal light rises from
the gloom of Gethsemane.&nbsp; Satan planted the tree of death on
the grave of the first Adam, and sought to plant it also on the
grave of the second; but how terrible was his disappointment and
despair, when he found that the wrong seed had been deposited
there, and was springing up unto everlasting life!&nbsp; Come!
fly to the shelter of this tree, and dwell in the shadow of its
branches, and eat of its fruit, and live!</p>
<p>To conclude:&mdash;Is not the conversion of sinners an object
dear to the hearts of the saints?&nbsp; God alone can do the
work.&nbsp; He can say to the north, give up; and to the south,
keep not back.&nbsp; He can bring his sons from afar, and his
daughters from the ends of the earth.&nbsp; Our Shiloh has an
attractive power, and to him shall the gathering of the people
be.&nbsp; Pray, my brethren, pray earnestly, that the God of all
grace may find them out, and gather them from the forest, and
fish them up from the sea, and bring them home as the shepherd
brings the stray lambs to the fold.&nbsp; God alone can <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>catch these
&ldquo;fowl of every wing.&rdquo;&nbsp; They fly away from
us.&nbsp; To our grief, they often fly far away, when we think
them almost in our hands; and then the most talented and holy
ministers cannot overtake them.&nbsp; But the Lord is swifter
than they.&nbsp; His arrows will reach them and bring them from
their lofty flight to the earth.&nbsp; Then he will heal their
wounds, and tame their wild nature, and give them rest beneath
the branches of the &ldquo;Goodly Cedar.&rdquo;</p>

THE PRINCE OF SALVATION.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>For it became him</i>, <i>for whom are
all things</i>, <i>and by whom are all things</i>, <i>in bringing
many sons to glory</i>, <i>to make the captain of their salvation
perfect through sufferings</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. ii. 10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And being made perfect</i>, <i>he became the author
of eternal salvation unto all them that obey
him</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. v. 9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> put these passages together
because of their similarity.&nbsp; In discussing the doctrine
which they contain&mdash;the doctrine of salvation through the
mediatorial work of Christ, I purpose to
consider&mdash;<i>First</i>, His relation to believers, as the
author, captain, or prince of their salvation; <i>Secondly</i>,
His perfect qualification, through meritorious sufferings, to
sustain that relation; and <i>Thirdly</i>, The character of those
who are interested in him as a Saviour.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Christ is the prince of our salvation.&nbsp; He is
the great ante-type of Moses, Joshua, Samson, and David.&nbsp;
Their deeds of pious valor faintly foreshadowed the glorious
achievements of the Captain of our salvation.</p>
<p>He is a prince in our nature.&nbsp; The Lord from heaven
became the second Adam, the seed of the woman, the offspring of
David.&nbsp; Divinity and humanity were mysteriously united in
his person.&nbsp; The Word that was in the beginning was made
flesh, and tabernacled among us.&nbsp; God is now nearer to his
people than ever.&nbsp; The Lamb&rsquo;s bride is bone of his
bone and flesh of his flesh.&nbsp; As the children were partakers
of flesh and blood, he himself took part of the same.&nbsp; By
taking human nature into union with himself, he has imparted to
believers a new and divine life.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>Our
Prince has conquered our adversaries.&nbsp; His name is Michael,
the power of God.&nbsp; He is the mighty prince that stood up on
behalf of his people, and bruised Satan under their feet.&nbsp;
He has cast out the strong man, and his goods.&nbsp; He has
demolished the kingdom of darkness, spoiled principalities and
powers, and made a show of them openly.&nbsp; He has proved to
earth and heaven that the devil is a usurper, and has no claim
whatever to the title, &ldquo;God of this world,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Prince of this world.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Christ was
crucified, hell quaked to its centre.&nbsp; Then he obtained
liberty for the captives, and the opening of the prisons to them
that are bound.&nbsp; His victory is our manumission from the
slavery of sin and death; and if the Son make us free, we are
free indeed.</p>
<p>Three offices meet in the Author of our salvation; the
prophetic, the priestly, and the regal.&nbsp; He wears three
crowns upon his head; a crown of gold, a crown of silver, and a
crown of precious stones.&nbsp; He &ldquo;shall bear the glory,
and shall sit and rule upon his throne, and shall be a priest
upon his throne, and the covenant of peace shall be between them
both.&rdquo;&nbsp; This prophecy is fulfilled in Messiah&rsquo;s
mediatorial relations.&nbsp; The house was purified, the altar
was consecrated, on the morning of his resurrection.&nbsp; This
is the Prince of life, who was dead, and is alive for evermore,
and hath the keys of hell and of death.&nbsp; That he might
sanctify the people with his own blood, he suffered without the
gate; and by suffering, he opened a way for believers into the
holiest of all; and lo! his people are standing before the
mercy-seat within the vail, and worshipping in open sight of the
glory of God that dwelleth between the cherubim.&nbsp; If God
smelled &ldquo;a savor of rest&rdquo; in the sacrifice of Noah,
much more in the sacrifice of his beloved Son, in whom he is ever
well pleased.&nbsp; His sinless soul and body were offered once
for all upon the cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;He bore the sins of many,
and made intercession for the transgressors.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Father proclaims the demands of his law fully answered, and
invites sinners to come and rest in the Beloved.&nbsp; This is he
of whom it was said&mdash;&ldquo;A man shall be as a hiding-place
from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water
in a dry place; as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the Author and Captain of our
salvation.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Let us consider how he is qualified for that
relation&mdash;made perfect through sufferings.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>His
sufferings were necessary to constitute him a complete
Saviour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Without the shedding of blood is no
remission;&rdquo; the blood of Jesus is &ldquo;a fountain opened
for sin and uncleanness.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
threatened&mdash;&ldquo;In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die;&rdquo; but Christ, by dying in our stead, delivered
us from the sentence.</p>
<p>In order that he might bear our sins, it was necessary for him
to assume our nature.&nbsp; The Priest must have somewhat to
offer as a sacrifice.&nbsp; Divinity could not suffer and
die.&nbsp; &ldquo;A body hast thou prepared for me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Son of God took that body as his own, and offered it to the
Father upon the cross.&nbsp; The blood which he shed was his own
blood; the life which he laid down was his own life; the soul
which he poured out unto death was his own soul.&nbsp; Moses saw
an emblem of this mystery in Mount Horeb&mdash;a bush burning
with fire, yet unconsumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our God is a consuming
fire,&rdquo; dwelling in a tabernacle of clay.&nbsp; The human
nature, though slain, is not consumed.&nbsp; On the third day the
bush is found still flourishing and fruitful.</p>
<p>It was necessary that the precept of the law should be obeyed,
and the penalty of the law endured, in the very nature of its
violater.&nbsp; Christ answered the demands of both tables on
behalf of his people, in the purity of his life, and the merit of
his obedience unto death.&nbsp; He displayed all the fruits of
holiness.&nbsp; He loved righteousness and hated iniquity.&nbsp;
He paid our debt, a debt which he never contracted; he endured
our curse, a curse which he never deserved.&nbsp; He took the cup
of the wine of wrath out of our hand, and drained its very dregs
upon the cross.&nbsp; In hell, every one drinks his own cup, and
can never exhaust its contents; but behold, on Calvary, one man
drains the cup of millions, and cries&mdash;&ldquo;It is
finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; Not a drop is left, not a particle of any
of its ingredients, for his people.&nbsp; God hath condemned and
punished sin in the human nature of Christ, and all who believe
are justified freely by his blood.</p>
<p>But the author of our salvation is God as well as man.&nbsp;
The Divinity often shone out through the humanity, controlling
the elements, quickening the tenants of the tomb, and compelling
the very devils to obey him.&nbsp; Had he been less than
&ldquo;God manifest in the flesh,&rdquo; he must have been
incompetent to the work of redemption.&nbsp; The Divine nature
was necessary to sustain the human nature under its immense
burden of sufferings, and render those <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>sufferings
sufficiently meritorious to atone for the transgressions of
mankind.&nbsp; Christ endured more of the Divine displeasure
&ldquo;from the sixth to the ninth hour,&rdquo; than all the
vessels of wrath could endure to all eternity; <a
name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a> and but for the union of the two
natures in his person, he could not have borne his unparalleled
woes.&nbsp; But while the man suffered, the God sustained.&nbsp;
While the God-man offered up his humanity, his Divinity was the
altar that sanctified the gift, and rendered it a sacrifice of
sweet smelling savor to the Father.&nbsp; It was man that died
upon the cross, but it was man in mysterious union with God, so
that the two natures constituted but one person, and the dignity
of the Godhead gave infinite value to the tears and sweat and
blood of the manhood.&nbsp; No wonder that the cross of Christ is
the admiration of men and angels; and&mdash;&ldquo;worthy is the
Lamb that was slain!&rdquo; the ultimate theme of earth and
heaven!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And being made perfect.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the twentieth
chapter of Exodus, we read of &ldquo;the ram of
consecration&rdquo;&mdash;the ram of perfection in the original,
or full ram, as the word full signifies complete, mature,
perfect.&nbsp; The two rams mentioned in that chapter represent
the atonement and intercession of Christ.&nbsp; He is our full,
complete, or perfect sacrifice.&nbsp; &ldquo;In him dwelleth the
fulness of the Godhead;&rdquo; and he has the hand of a man to
bestow blessings upon his brethren.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of his fulness
have all we received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are all in
the Son of man.&nbsp; Aaron never entered the holy place with
empty hands, and our great High-priest hath gone into the
celestial sanctuary, bearing with him his own most precious
blood, wherewith to sprinkle the mercy-seat, and make it
approachable to man.&nbsp; Thus suffering on earth, and pleading
the merit of his suffering in heaven, &ldquo;he becomes the
author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; This leads us to our third topic.&nbsp; The
character of those who are interested in him as a
Saviour&mdash;&ldquo;all them that obey him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To obey is to submit to authority&mdash;to do what is
commanded.&nbsp; What is the command of God the Father?&nbsp;
That ye should believe on the name of his Son.&nbsp; What is the
command of Christ, the Captain of our salvation?&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye
believe in God; believe also in <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>me.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is said that he
is precious to them that believe, but unbelievers are
disobedient.&nbsp; They are all a disaffected and rebellious
army, who will not obey their Captain.&nbsp; They have made God a
liar, and are condemned for their unbelief.&nbsp; The Father
saith&mdash;&ldquo;Kiss the Son, lest he be angry!&rdquo; but
they reply&mdash;&ldquo;Away with him! away with him! we will not
have him to reign over us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is this your character?&nbsp; You are commanded to
&ldquo;behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Have you obeyed?&nbsp; What are you
doing?&nbsp; Are you determined to rebel?&nbsp; Will you risk the
consequences of disobedience?&nbsp; O, you are reading the book
of election, are you?&nbsp; You are looking for your names in the
book of election; but lo! you find them written in the book of
damnation, under the article&mdash;&ldquo;He that believeth not
shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; What shall be done in such a case?&nbsp; Obey
the Captain of your salvation.&nbsp; Do ye not hear him, as he
rides along the ranks, proclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;To-day, if ye
will hear my voice, harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation!&nbsp; Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and
your soul shall live!&rdquo;&nbsp; Obey, obey this gracious
exhortation.&nbsp; Come, with your petitions for pardon.&nbsp;
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved.&nbsp;
Behold a door of hope opening for you in the blood of
atonement.&nbsp; There is forgiveness and sanctification for all
that believe.&nbsp; Does your sense of guilt overwhelm you with
gloomy fears, and plunge you in despair?&nbsp; Do you tremble at
the thought of the multitude and enormity of your crimes?&nbsp;
Cry aloud, with all your hearts&mdash;&ldquo;God be merciful to
me a sinner!&rdquo;&nbsp; Remember that your Prince &ldquo;is
able to save unto the uttermost all that come unto God by
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hear him calling you&mdash;&ldquo;Come unto me,
all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest!&nbsp; Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek
and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls; for my
yoke is easy, and my burden is light!&rdquo;&nbsp; Who, then,
would not obey thee, blessed Jesus?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Had I, dear Lord, a thousand hearts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give them all to thee;<br />
A thousand tongues, they all should join<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grateful harmony!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a remarkable instance of faith and obedience in
Abraham.&nbsp; There was no natural probability, there was no
apparent <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>possibility of the fulfilment of the promise; but
Abraham believed, rested on the naked word of God, and went to
mount Moriah to offer up his only son.&nbsp; Here was the triumph
of faith, and it is recorded for our encouragement.&nbsp; Did the
patriarch firmly believe the promise&mdash;&ldquo;In Isaac shall
thy seed be called?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes verily, and it was accounted
to him for righteousness.&nbsp; Did the patriarch believe, on the
strength of that promise, that God would not permit him to offer
up his only son?&nbsp; No, verily; but he was determined to obey
God, and leave the event with him, well assured that God would
fulfil his word, though it should require the miracle of
Isaac&rsquo;s resurrection.&nbsp; Thus your faith must soar above
nature, and lay hold on the righteousness of Christ, which
justifieth the ungodly.&nbsp; When you believe with all your
heart, God will smile upon you, and calm your troubled soul, and
hush the raging storms of a guilty conscience, for the sake of
the satisfaction which he received in the obedience of Christ, as
the substitute and surety of his people.&nbsp; This is the Urim
and Thummim&mdash;light and perfection&mdash;of the gospel,
beaming upon us through the twelve stars&mdash;the apostles of
the Lamb, pacifying the conscience, and answering the important
question&mdash;&ldquo;What shall I do to be saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
feel within me a sea of corruption, but I know that the blood of
Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin.</p>
<p>Faith and obedience are inseparable, and the former is dead
without the latter.&nbsp; They wrought together in Abel, and
therefore he offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.&nbsp;
They wrought together in Noah, and led him to prepare an ark to
the saving of his house.&nbsp; Abraham not only believed that God
would give him and his seed the land of Canaan; but he set forth
at the Divine command, not knowing whither he went.&nbsp; Moses
not only believed that God would deliver Israel out of Egypt;
but, in obedience to his command, he &ldquo;refused to be called
the son of Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter; choosing rather to suffer
affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of
sin for a season.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, true faith always leads to
obedience.&nbsp; It is a living principle, by which the soul is
quickened from the death of sin to a new life of holiness.&nbsp;
It is the means through which, by the Holy Ghost, we are created
anew in Christ Jesus unto good works.&nbsp; It works by love, and
love is always the great motive to obedience.&nbsp; It gives us
large and clear views of the love of God in Christ; then
&ldquo;we love him because <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>he first loved us;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;this is the love of God, that we keep his
commandments.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, by faith, &ldquo;the love of God
is shed abroad in our hearts,&rdquo; leading us to a holy
life.&nbsp; Such is the connection between faith and obedience,
and the necessity of one to the other.</p>
<p>And now, brethren, let us trust in the Captain of our
salvation.&nbsp; In the ages before his advent, many sons were
brought to glory through faith in his future sufferings.&nbsp; In
the fulness of time, he visited our world; assumed our nature;
atoned for our transgressions; and, ascending to the right hand
of the Father, as our representative and intercessor,
&ldquo;became the author of eternal salvation to all them that
obey him.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O Captain of salvation! make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy power and glory known,<br />
Till clouds of willing captives come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And worship at thy throne!&rdquo;</p>

FINISHED REDEMPTION</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>It is finished</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;John
xix. 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> exclamation derives all its
importance from the magnitude of the work alluded to, and the
glorious character of the agent.&nbsp; The work is the redemption
of the world; the agent is God manifest in the flesh.&nbsp; He
who finished the creation of the heavens and the earth in six
days, is laying the foundation of a new creation on
Calvary.&nbsp; Four thousand years he has been giving notice of
his intention to mankind; more than thirty years he has been
personally upon earth, preparing the material; and now he lays
the chief corner stone in Zion, exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;It is
finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We will first consider the special import of the exclamation,
and then offer a few remarks of a more general character.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo;&nbsp; This saying of
the Son of God is a very striking one; and, uttered, as it was,
while he hung in dying agonies upon the cross, cannot fail to
make a strong impression upon the mind.&nbsp; It is natural for
us to inquire&mdash;&ldquo;What does it mean?&nbsp; To what does
the glorious victim refer?&rdquo;&nbsp; A complete answer to the
question would develope the whole scheme of redemption.&nbsp; We
can only glance at a few leading ideas.</p>
<p>The sufferings of Christ are ended.&nbsp; Never again shall he
be persecuted from city to city, as an impostor and servant of
Satan.&nbsp; Never again shall he say&mdash;&ldquo;My soul is
exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never again
shall he agonize in Gethsemane, and sweat great drops of
blood.&nbsp; Never again shall he be derided by the rabble, and
insulted by men in power.&nbsp; Never again shall he be crowned
with thorns, lacerated by the scourge, and nailed to the accursed
tree.&nbsp; Never again shall he cry out, in the anguish of <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>his soul,
and the baptism of blood&mdash;&ldquo;My God! my God! why hast
thou forsaken me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The predictions of his death are fulfilled.&nbsp; The prophets
had spoken of his crucifixion many hundred years before his
birth.&nbsp; They foresaw the Governor who was to come forth from
Bethlehem.&nbsp; They knew the babe in the manger, as he whose
goings forth are of old, even from everlasting.&nbsp; They drew
an accurate chart of his travels, from the manger to the cross,
and from the cross to the throne.&nbsp; All these things must be
fulfilled.&nbsp; Jesus knew the necessity, and seemed anxious
that every jot and tittle should receive an exact
accomplishment.&nbsp; His whole life was a fulfilment of
prophecy.&nbsp; On every path he walked, on every house he
entered, on every city he visited, and especially on the
mysterious phenomena which accompanied his crucifixion, it was
written&mdash;&ldquo;that the Scriptures might be
fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great sacrifice for sin is accomplished.&nbsp; For this
purpose Christ came into the world.&nbsp; He is our appointed
high-priest, the elect of the Father, and the desire of
nations.&nbsp; He alone who was in the bosom of the Father, could
offer a sacrifice of sufficient merit to atone for human
transgression.&nbsp; But it was necessary also that he should
have somewhat to offer.&nbsp; Therefore a body was prepared for
him.&nbsp; He assumed the seed of Abraham, and suffered in the
flesh.&nbsp; This was a sacrifice of infinite value, being
sanctified by the altar of Divinity on which it was
offered.&nbsp; All the ceremonial sacrifices could not obtain the
bond from the hand of the creditor.&nbsp; They were only
acknowledgments of the debt.&nbsp; But Jesus, by one offering,
paid the whole, took up the bond&mdash;the handwriting that was
against us, and nailed it to his cross; and when driving the last
nail, he cried&mdash;&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The satisfaction of Divine justice is completed.&nbsp; The
violated law must be vindicated; the deserved penalty must be
endured; if not by the sinner himself, yet by the sinner&rsquo;s
substitute.&nbsp; This was the great undertaking of the Son of
God.&nbsp; He &ldquo;bore our sins&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the
punishment of our sins&mdash;&ldquo;in his own body on the
tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was &ldquo;made a curse for us, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was no other way by which the honor of God and the dignity of his
law could be sustained, and therefore &ldquo;the Lord laid upon
him the iniquities of us all.&rdquo;&nbsp; He &ldquo;died unto
sin once;&rdquo; not merely for sin, enduring its punishment in
our stead; but also <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>&ldquo;unto sin,&rdquo; abolishing
its power, and putting it away.&nbsp; Therefore it is said, he
&ldquo;made an end of sin&rdquo;&mdash;destroyed its condemning
and tormenting power on behalf of all them that believe.&nbsp;
His sufferings were equal to the claims of justice; and his dying
cry was the voice of Justice himself proclaiming the
satisfaction.&nbsp; Here, then, may the dying thief, and the
persecutor of the holy, lay down their load of guilt and wo at
the foot of the cross.</p>
<p>The new and living way to God is consecrated.&nbsp; A vail has
hitherto concealed the holy of holies.&nbsp; None but the
high-priest has seen the ark of the covenant, and the glory of
God resting upon the mercy-seat between the cherubim.&nbsp; He
alone might enter, and he but once a year, and then with fear and
trembling, and the sprinkling of atoning blood, after the most
careful purification, and sacrifice for himself and the
people.&nbsp; But our great High-priest has made an end of
sacrifice by the one offering of himself.&nbsp; He has filled his
hands with his own blood, and entered into heaven itself, there
to appear in the presence of God for us.&nbsp; The sweet incense
which he offers fills the temple, and the merit of his sacrifice
remains the same through all time, superseding all other offering
for ever.&nbsp; Therefore we are exhorted to come boldly to the
throne of grace.&nbsp; The tunnel under the Thames could not be
completed on account of an accident which greatly damaged the
work, without a new subscription for raising money; but Jesus
found infinite riches in himself, sufficient for the completion
of a new way to the Father&mdash;a living way through the valley
of the shadow of death to &ldquo;the city of the Great
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conquest of the powers of darkness is achieved.&nbsp; When
their hour was come, the Prince and his hosts were on the alert
to accomplish the destruction of the Son of God.&nbsp; They
assailed him with peculiar temptations, and leveled against him
their heaviest artillery.&nbsp; They instigated one disciple to
betray him and another to deny him.&nbsp; They fired the rage of
the multitude against him, so that the same tongues that lately
sung&mdash;&ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David!&rdquo; now
shouted&mdash;&ldquo;Crucify him!&nbsp; Crucify him!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They filled the priests and scribes with envy, that they might
accuse him without a cause; and inspired Pilate with an accursed
ambition, that he might condemn him without a fault.&nbsp; They
seared the conscience of the false witnesses, that they might
charge the Just One with the most flagrant crimes; and cauterized
the hearts of the <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>Roman soldiers, that they might mock him in his
sufferings, and nail him to the cross.&nbsp; Having succeeded so
far in their hellish plot, they doubtless deemed their victory
certain.&nbsp; I see them crowding around the cross, waiting
impatiently to witness his last breath, ready to shout with
infernal triumph to the depths of hell, till the brazen walls
should send back their echoes to the gates of the heavenly
city.&nbsp; But hark! the dying Saviour exclaims&mdash;&ldquo;It
is finished!&rdquo; and the great dragon and his host retreat,
howling, from the cross.&nbsp; The Prince of our salvation turned
back all their artillery upon themselves, and their own
stratagems become their ruin.&nbsp; The old serpent seized
Messiah&rsquo;s heel, but Messiah stamped upon the
serpent&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The dying cry of Jesus shook the
dominions of death, so that the bodies of many that slept arose;
and rang through all the depths of hell, the knell of its
departed power.&nbsp; Thus the Prince of this world was foiled in
his schemes, and disappointed in his hopes; like the men of Gaza,
when they locked up Samson at night, thinking to kill him in the
morning; but awoke to find that he was gone, with the gates of
the city upon his shoulders.&nbsp; When the Philistines caught
Samson, and brought him to their temple, to make sport for them,
they never dreamed of the disaster in which it would
result&mdash;never dreamed that their triumph over the poor blind
captive would be the occasion of their destruction.&nbsp; Suffer
me, said he, to lean on the two pillars.&nbsp; Then he bowed
himself, and died with his enemies.&nbsp; So Christ on Calvary,
while the powers of darkness exulted over their victim, seized
the main pillars of sin and death, and brought down the temple of
Satan upon its occupants; but on the morning of the third day, he
left them all in the ruins, where they shall remain for ever, and
commenced his journey home to his Father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; So much concerning the import of our Saviour&rsquo;s
exclamation.&nbsp; Such was the work which he finished upon the
cross.&nbsp; We add a few remarks of a more general
character.</p>
<p>The sufferings of Christ were vicarious.&nbsp; He died, not
for his own sins, but for ours.&nbsp; He humbled himself, that we
might be exalted.&nbsp; He became poor, that we might be made
rich.&nbsp; He was wounded, that we might be healed.&nbsp; He
drained the cup of wrath, that we might drink the waters of
salvation.&nbsp; He died the shameful and excruciating death of
the cross, that we might live and reign with him for ever.</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>&ldquo;Ought not Christ to have suffered these things,
and to have entered into his glory?&rdquo;&nbsp; This
&ldquo;ought&rdquo; is the ought of mercy and of covenant
engagement.&nbsp; He must discharge the obligation which he had
voluntarily assumed.&nbsp; He must finish the work which he had
graciously begun.&nbsp; There was no other Saviour&mdash;no other
being in the universe willing to undertake the work; or, if any
willing to undertake, none able to accomplish it.&nbsp; The
salvation of one human soul would have been too mighty an
achievement for Gabriel&mdash;for all the angels in heaven.&nbsp;
Had not &ldquo;the Only Begotten of the Father&rdquo; become our
surety, we must have lain for ever under the wrath of God, amid
&ldquo;weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
None but the Lion of the tribe of Judah could break the seals of
that mysterious book.&nbsp; None but &ldquo;God manifest in the
flesh&rdquo; could deliver us from the second death.</p>
<p>The dying cry of Jesus indicates the dignity of his nature,
and the power of life that was in him to the last.&nbsp; All men
die of weakness&mdash;of inability to resist death&mdash;die
because they can live no longer.&nbsp; But this was not the case
with the Son of God.&nbsp; He speaks of laying down his life as
his own voluntary act;&mdash;&ldquo;No man taketh it from me, but
I lay it down of myself.&nbsp; I have power to lay it down, and I
have power to take it again.&rdquo;&nbsp; He &ldquo;poured out
his soul unto death&rdquo;&mdash;did not wait for it to be torn
from him&mdash;did not hang languishing upon the cross, till life
&ldquo;ebbed out by slow degrees;&rdquo; but poured it out
freely, suddenly, and unexpectedly.&nbsp; As soon as the work was
done for which he came into the world, he cried&mdash;&ldquo;It
is finished!&rdquo; &ldquo;bowed his head, and gave up the
ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the sun was darkened, the earth quaked,
the rocks rent, the graves opened, and the centurion
said&mdash;&ldquo;Truly, this man was the Son of
God!&rdquo;&nbsp; He cried with a loud voice, to show that he was
still unconquered by pain, mighty even upon the cross.&nbsp; He
bowed his head that death might seize him.&nbsp; He was naturally
far above the reach of death, his Divine nature being
self-existent and eternal, and his human nature entitled to
immortality by its immaculate holiness; yet &ldquo;he humbled
himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
cross&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He bowed his head, and gave up the
ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may regard his last exclamation, also, as an expression of
his joy, at having accomplished the great &ldquo;travail of his
soul,&rdquo; in the work of our redemption.&nbsp; It was the work
which the Father had <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>given him, and which he had
covenanted to do.&nbsp; It lay heavy upon his heart; and O, how
was he straitened till it was accomplished!&nbsp; His &ldquo;soul
was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death;&rdquo; &ldquo;and his
sweat as it were great drops of blood, falling down to the
ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; But upon the cross, he saw of the travail of
his soul, and was satisfied.&nbsp; He saw that his sacrifice was
accepted, and the object of his agony secured&mdash;that death
would not be able to detain him in the grave, nor hell to defeat
the purposes of his grace&mdash;that the gates of the eternal
city would soon open to receive him as a conqueror, and myriads
of exultant angels shout him to his throne; whither he would be
followed by his redeemed, with songs of everlasting joy.&nbsp; He
saw, and he was satisfied; and, not waiting for the morning of
the third day, but already confident of victory, he uttered this
note of triumph, and died.</p>
<p>And if we may suppose them to have understood its import, what
a source of consolation must it have been to his sorrowing
disciples!&nbsp; The sword had pierced through Mary&rsquo;s
heart, according to the prediction of old Simeon over the infant
Jesus.&nbsp; Her affections had bled at the agony of her
supernatural Son, and her wounded faith had wellnigh perished at
his cross.&nbsp; And how must all his followers have felt,
standing afar off, and beholding their supposed Redeemer
suffering as a malefactor!&nbsp; How must all their hopes have
died within them, as they gazed on the accursed tree!&nbsp; The
tragedy was mysterious, and they deemed their enemies
victorious.&nbsp; Jesus is treading the winepress in Bozrah, and
the earth is shaking, and the rocks are rending, and the
luminaries of heaven are expiring, and all the powers of nature
are fainting, in sympathy with his mighty agony.&nbsp; Now he is
lost in the fire and smoke of battle, and the dread artillery of
justice is heard thundering through the thick darkness, and
shouts of victory rise from the troops of hell, and who shall
foretell the issue of the combat, or the fate of the
Champion?&nbsp; But lo! he cometh forth from the cloud of battle,
with blood upon his garments!&nbsp; He is wounded, but he hath
the tread and the aspect of a conqueror.&nbsp; He waves his
crimsoned sword, and cries&mdash;&ldquo;It is
finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; Courage, ye weepers at the cross!&nbsp;
Courage, ye tremblers standing afar off!&nbsp; The Prince of your
salvation is victor, and this bulletin of the war shall cheer
myriads of believers in the house of their pilgrimage, and the
achievement which it announces shall constitute an everlasting
theme of praise!</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; The word smote on
the walls of the celestial city, and thrilled the hosts of heaven
with ecstasy unspeakable.&nbsp; How must &ldquo;the spirits of
just men made perfect&rdquo; have leaped with joy, to hear that
the Captain of their salvation was victorious over all his
enemies, and that the work he had engaged to do for them and
their brethren was completed! and with what wonder and delight
must the holy angels have witnessed the triumph of him, whom they
were commanded to worship, over the powers of darkness!&nbsp; It
was the commencement of a new era in heaven, and never before had
its happy denizens seen so much of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;&nbsp; Go, ye heralds of
salvation, into all the world, and proclaim the joyful
tidings!&nbsp; Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up your voice like
a trumpet, and publish to all men, that the work of the cross is
finished&mdash;that the great Mediator, &ldquo;made perfect
through sufferings,&rdquo; has become &ldquo;the author of
eternal salvation to all them that obey
him&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;is of God made unto us, wisdom, and
righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Go, teach the degraded Pagan, the deluded Mohammedan, and the
superstitious Papist, that the finished work of Jesus is the only
way of acceptance with God!&nbsp; Go, tell the polished scholar,
the profound philosopher, and the vaunting moralist, that the
doctrine of Christ crucified is the only knowledge that can save
the soul!&nbsp; Go, say to the proud skeptic, the bold
blasphemer, and the polluted libertine, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of
God that taketh away the sin of the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; Preach it
to the gasping sinner upon his death-bed, and the sullen murderer
in his cell!&nbsp; Let it ring in every human ear, and thrill in
every human heart, till the gladness of earth shall be the
counterpart of heaven!</p>

THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>He is not here</i>; <i>for he is
risen</i>, <i>as he said</i>.&nbsp; <i>Come</i>, <i>see the place
where the Lord lay</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. xxviii. 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> celebrated Jonathan Edwards of
America begins his History of Redemption with an account of the
Lord&rsquo;s visit to Adam and Eve at the cool of the day in
Eden.&nbsp; All the wonderful works of God toward the children of
men, since the seed of the woman was promised to bruise the
serpent&rsquo;s head, are to be considered as so many parts of
the same great machinery of providence, whose wheels, like those
of Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision, all move in majestic harmony, though
their thousand revolutions may seem to us discordant and
confused.&nbsp; The chief design of all the Divine manifestations
recorded in the Old Testament was to prepare the way for the
Redeemer&rsquo;s appearance upon earth.&nbsp; Jehovah often
suffered his people to be in great distress and perplexity; he
lengthened the chain of Satan and his angels, allowed a partial
success of their infernal schemes, and permitted them to prevail
for a season against his people, and pride themselves in their
power and their skill, in order to make their defeat the more
signal, and gather more glory to himself from their final
overthrow.&nbsp; During the engagement, the victory often seemed
to be on the side of the enemy; but when the smoke of battle
cleared away, the pillar of God was seen upon the camp of
Israel.&nbsp; If his people are besieged between Pi-hahiroth and
Baal-zephon, he raises the siege by dividing the sea, and making
a highway through the deep, while the waters rise up in a solid
wall on the right and the left, and roll back in ruin on the
pursuing foe.&nbsp; If an army comes to arrest Elisha on Carmel,
the mountain is <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>covered with celestial warriors, and the surrounding
heavens teem with horsemen and chariots of fire, and the enemy
are smitten with blindness, and taken captive by the
prophet.&nbsp; If Goliath of Gath confronts the camp of Israel
with his challenge, roaring like a lion, till the valley resounds
with his voice, a little shepherd-boy goes forth with his sling,
and the vaunting blasphemer is smitten to the ground, and slain
with his own sword.&nbsp; If the worshippers of the true God are
cast into the fiery furnace, or the den of lions, to show the
power and gratify the pride of an infamous tyrant, there is one
among them &ldquo;like unto the Son of Man,&rdquo; and the
violence of the fire is quenched, and the mouths of the lions are
stopped.</p>
<p>But when Messiah was slain and buried, the enemies of God
boasted more than ever in their crafty and malicious
schemes.&nbsp; This was the great decisive engagement between
Heaven and hell.&nbsp; The enemy imagined &ldquo;the Captain of
our salvation&rdquo; vanquished and destroyed.&nbsp; But his fall
was no defeat.&nbsp; He yielded to the powers of darkness
apparently, that he might triumph over them openly.&nbsp; He
suffered himself to be taken prisoner by death, that he might
seize the tyrant on his throne, demolish his empire, and deliver
his captives.&nbsp; And if none of his friends on earth had
courage to proclaim his resurrection, a preacher descended from
heaven to announce the joyful fact:&mdash;&ldquo;He is not here;
for he is risen, as he said.&nbsp; Come, see the place where the
Lord lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wonderful message, and wonderful messenger!&nbsp; On the
morning of the third day after his crucifixion, Jesus revived in
his tomb, and the sound of the earthquake reached the heaven of
heavens, and a mighty angel, swifter than the light, descended
straight to the new grave in Joseph&rsquo;s garden, calling on no
one for the key, instantly rolled away the stone from the door,
and sat upon it, and made it his pulpit, from which he preached
to the women the doctrine of our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>Let us consider, <i>first</i>, the testimony by which this
fact is sustained, and <i>secondly</i>, the fact itself, as the
sure basis of Christianity.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; It appears from the record of the evangelist Luke,
that the women were much perplexed at finding the stone rolled
away from the mouth of the sepulchre, and the body of Jesus
gone.&nbsp; Then they were saluted by two angels in shining
apparel, who said;&mdash;&ldquo;Why seek ye the living among the
dead?&nbsp; He is not here, but is risen.&nbsp; Remember how he
spake unto you while he was yet in Galilee, <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>saying&mdash;The Son of Man must be delivered into the
hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise
again.&nbsp; And they remembered his words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is the testimony of two credible witnesses, a sufficient
number to attest the truth of our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection; who
testified to nothing but what they had personally witnessed, and
knew to be fact; and delivered their testimony in simple and
unambiguous language, that could not well be misunderstood.</p>
<p>While the women went to inform the disciples of what they had
seen and heard, &ldquo;behold, some of the watch came into the
city, and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were
done.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what was done?&nbsp; What can be the
testimony of these enemies of Christ concerning his
resurrection?&nbsp; That &ldquo;an angel, whose countenance was
like lightning, and his garments white as snow, descended from
heaven, and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon
it;&rdquo; which so terrified them that they &ldquo;became as
dead men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To confirm these testimonies, our blessed Lord himself
&ldquo;appeared unto many after his resurrection, who were
witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the
Jews, and at Jerusalem; and how he was slain, and hanged on a
tree; and how God raised him up the third day, and showed him
openly; not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before of
God; even to the disciples, who did eat and drink with him after
he rose from the dead; whom he commanded to preach unto the
people, and to testify that it is he who is ordained of God to be
the judge of quick and dead&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to whom he showed
himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs; being
seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to
the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we may observe, that he appeared to those who knew him
best, and gave them satisfactory and incontestible evidence of
his resurrection.&nbsp; And he appeared, not only to the
apostles, but to more than five hundred brethren at once.&nbsp;
We have an account of his appearing at ten or eleven different
times.&nbsp; On these occasions, he conversed with his disciples,
reminded them of what he had said to them before his crucifixion,
showed them his hands and his feet, and besought them to touch
arid examine his person, and satisfy themselves as to his
identity.&nbsp; So that they had ample opportunity, and every
facility that could be desired, for ascertaining whether he <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>was indeed
Jesus of Nazareth, their master, who was lately crucified before
their eyes.</p>
<p>It was therefore with great power that the apostles bore
witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.&nbsp; And the Holy
Spirit corroborated their testimony.&nbsp; Our faith in this
distinctive doctrine of Christianity rests on a Divine
foundation.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we receive the witness of men, the
witness of God is greater.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And the apostles
went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord also working with
them, and confirming the word with signs following.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In a few weeks after the resurrection of their Master, their
testimony concerning it was received and firmly believed by many
thousands, not in some distant and desert part of the world, but
in Jerusalem, where he had been crucified.</p>
<p>How nobly the apostle Peter reasoned on this subject when he
said:&mdash;&ldquo;Ye men of Israel, hear these words.&nbsp;
Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles,
and wonders, and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you,
as ye yourselves also know; him, being delivered by the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and
by wicked hands have crucified and slain; whom God hath raised
up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible
that he should be holden of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the evidence of our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, that
among those who were living at the time, and even those of them
who so strenuously opposed the gospel, it appears to have been
scarcely doubted.&nbsp; Pilate, in a letter to Tiberius, the
Roman emperor, said, that Jesus, being raised from the dead, was
believed by many to be God; whereupon the Roman Senate expressed
no doubt of his resurrection, but debated the question of
receiving him as one of the gods of Rome; which, however, was
overruled by Divine Providence, for the honor of Christianity;
for he who is higher than heaven, and the heaven of heavens, was
not to be ranked with dumb idols upon earth.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Let us now consider the fact of our Lord&rsquo;s
resurrection, and its bearing upon the great truths of our holy
religion.</p>
<p>This most transcendent of miracles is sometimes attributed to
the agency of the Father; who, as the Lawgiver, had arrested and
imprisoned in the grave the sinner&rsquo;s Surety, manifesting at
once his benevolence and his holiness; but by liberating the
prisoner, proclaimed <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>that the debt was cancelled, and the
claims of the law satisfied.&nbsp; It is sometimes attributed to
the Son himself; who had power both to lay down his life, and to
take it again; and the merit of whose sacrifice entitled him to
the honor of thus asserting his dominion over death, on behalf of
his people.&nbsp; And sometimes it is attributed to the Holy
Spirit, as in the following words of the apostle:&mdash;&ldquo;He
was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
Spirit of Holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The resurrection of Christ is clear and incontestible proof
of his Divinity</i>.</p>
<p>He had declared himself equal with God the Father, and one
with him in nature and in glory.&nbsp; He had told the people
that he would prove the truth of this declaration, by rising from
the grave three days after his death.&nbsp; And when the morning
of the third day began to dawn upon the sepulchre, lo! there was
an earthquake, and the dead body arose, triumphant over the power
of corruption.</p>
<p>This was the most stupendous miracle ever exhibited on earth,
and its language is:&mdash;&ldquo;Behold, ye persecuting Jews and
murdering Romans, the proof of my Godhead!&nbsp; Behold,
Caiaphas, Herod, Pilate, the power and glory of your
victim!&nbsp; I am he that liveth, and was dead; and lo!&nbsp; I
am alive for evermore!&nbsp; I am the root and the offspring of
David, and the bright and morning star!&nbsp; Look unto me, and
be ye saved, all ye ends of the earth; for I am God, and besides
me there is none else!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection affords incontrovertible
evidence of the truth of Christianity</i>.</p>
<p>Pilate wrote the title of Christ in three languages on the
cross; and many have written excellent and unanswerable things,
on the truth of the Christian Scriptures, and the reality of the
Christian religion; but the best argument that has ever been
written on the subject, was written by the invisible hand of the
Eternal Power, in the rocks of our Saviour&rsquo;s
sepulchre.&nbsp; This confounds the skeptic, settles the
controversy, and affords an ample and sure foundation for all
them that believe.</p>
<p>If any one asks whether Christianity is from heaven or of men,
we point him to the &ldquo;tomb hewn out of the rock,&rdquo; and
say&mdash;&ldquo;There is your answer!&nbsp; Jesus was crucified,
and laid in that cave; but on the morning of the third day, it
was found empty; our Master had risen and gone forth from the
grave victorious.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>This
is the pillar that supports the whole fabric of our religion; and
he who attempts to pull it down, like Samson, pulls down ruin
upon himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Christ is not risen, then is our
preaching vain, and your faith is also vain, ye are yet in your
sins;&rdquo; but if the fact is clearly proved, then Christianity
is unquestionably true, and its disciples are safe.</p>
<p>This is the ground on which the apostle stood, and asserted
the divinity of his faith:&mdash;&ldquo;Moreover, I testify unto
you the gospel, which I preached unto you; which also ye have
received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye
keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed
in vain; for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he rose again the
third day, according to the Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The resurrection of Jesus is the most stupendous
manifestation of the power of God</i>, <i>and the pledge of
eternal life to his people</i>.</p>
<p>The apostle calls it &ldquo;the exceeding greatness of his
power to usward who believe, according to the working of his
mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from
the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a river overflowing its
banks&mdash;an idea too large for language.&nbsp; Let us look at
it a moment.</p>
<p>Where do we find &ldquo;the exceeding greatness of his
power?&rdquo;&nbsp; In the creation of the world? in the Seven
Stars and Orion? in the strength of Behemoth and Leviathan?&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; In the deluge? in the fiery destruction of Sodom? in
the overthrow of Pharaoh and his host? in hurling Nebuchadnezzar
like Lucifer from the political firmament?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; It is
the power which he wrought in Christ.&nbsp; When?&nbsp; When he
healed the sick? when he raised the dead? when he cast out
devils? when he blasted the fruitless fig-tree? when he walked
upon the waters of the Galilee?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; It was
&ldquo;when he raised him from the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the
Father placed the sceptre in the hand of the Son, &ldquo;and set
him above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion,
and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in
that which is to come; and put all things under his feet, and
gave him to be head over all things to the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the source of our spiritual life.&nbsp; The same power
that raised the dead body of our Lord from the grave, quickens
the soul <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>of the believer from the death in trespasses and
sins.&nbsp; His riven tomb is a fountain of living waters;
whereof if a man drink, he shall never die.&nbsp; His raised and
glorified body is the sun, whence streams eternal light upon our
spirits; the light of life, that never can be quenched.</p>
<p>Nor here does the influence of his resurrection end.&nbsp; He
who raised up Jesus from the dead shall also quicken our mortal
bodies.&nbsp; His resurrection is the pledge and the pattern of
ours.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because he liveth we shall live
also.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall change our vile body, that it
may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
hear him speaking in the prophet:&mdash;&ldquo;Thy dead men shall
live; together with my dead body shall they arise.&nbsp; Awake
and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of
herbs, and the earth shall cast out her dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How divinely does the apostle speak of the resurrection-body
of the saints!&nbsp; &ldquo;It is sown in corruption, it is
raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in
glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown
a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.&nbsp; For this
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality.&nbsp; Then shall be brought to pass the saying that
is written&mdash;Death is swallowed up in victory!&nbsp; O death,
where is thy sting?&nbsp; O grave, where is thy victory?&nbsp;
Thanks be unto God, that giveth us the victory, through our Lord
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ever since the fall in Eden, man is born to die.&nbsp; He
lives to die.&nbsp; He eats and drinks, sleeps and wakes, to
die.&nbsp; Death, like a dark steel-clad warrior, stands ever
before us; and his gigantic shadow comes continually between us
and happiness.&nbsp; But Christ hath &ldquo;abolished death, and
brought life and immortality to light through the
gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was born in Bethlehem, that he might die
on Calvary.&nbsp; He was made under the law, that he might bear
the direst penalty of the law.&nbsp; He lived thirty-three years,
sinless among sinners, that he might offer himself a sin-offering
for sinners upon the cross.&nbsp; Thus he &ldquo;became obedient
unto death,&rdquo; that he might destroy the power of death; and
on the third morning, a mighty angel, rolling away the stone from
the mouth of the sepulchre, makes the very door of Death&rsquo;s
castle the throne whence he proclaims &ldquo;the resurrection and
the life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hero of our salvation travelled into Death&rsquo;s
dominion, took <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>possession of the whole territory on our behalf, and
returning laden with spoils, ascended to the heaven of
heavens.&nbsp; He went to the palace, seized the tyrant, and
wrested away his sceptre.&nbsp; He descended into the
prison-house, knocked off the fetters of the captives; and when
he came up again, left the door of every cell open, that they
might follow him.&nbsp; He has gone over into our promised
inheritance, and his glory illuminates the mountains of
immortality; and through the telescope which he has bequeathed
us, we &ldquo;see the land that is very far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I recollect reading in the writings of Flavel this
sentiment&mdash;that the souls in paradise wait with intense
desire for the reanimation of their dead bodies, that they may be
united to them in bliss for ever.&nbsp; O, what rapture there
shall be among the saints, when those frail vessels, from which
they escaped with such a struggle, as they foundered in the gulf
of death, shall come floating in, with the spring-tide of the
resurrection, to the harbor of immortality!&nbsp; How glorious
the reunion, when the seeds of affliction and death are left
behind in the tomb!&nbsp; Jacob no longer lame, nor Moses slow of
speech, nor Lazarus covered with sores, nor Paul troubled with a
thorn in the flesh!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know
that when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see
him as he is.&rdquo;&nbsp; The glory of the body of Christ is far
above our present conception.&nbsp; When he was transfigured on
Tabor, his face shone like the sun, and his raiment was white as
the light.&nbsp; This is the pattern shown to his people in the
mount.&nbsp; This is the model after which the bodies of
believers shall be fashioned in the resurrection.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars
for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion:&mdash;The angel said to the
women&mdash;&ldquo;Go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is
risen from the dead; and behold, he goeth before you into
Galilee; there shall ye see him; lo! I have told you.&nbsp; And
they departed quickly from the sepulchre, with fear and great
joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brethren! followers of Jesus! be ye also preachers of a risen
Saviour!&nbsp; Go quickly&mdash;there is no time for
delay&mdash;and publish the glad tidings to sinners!&nbsp; Tell
them that Christ died for their sins, and rose again for their
justification, and ascended to the right hand <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>of the
Father to make intercession for them, and is now able to save
unto the uttermost all that come unto God by him!</p>
<p>And you, impenitent and unbelieving men! hear this blessed
message of salvation!&nbsp; Do you intend ever to embrace the
proffered mercy of the gospel?&nbsp; Make haste!&nbsp;
Procrastination is ruin!&nbsp; Now is the accepted time!&nbsp; O,
fly to the throne of grace!&nbsp; Time is hastening; you will
soon be swallowed up in eternity!&nbsp; May the Lord have mercy
upon you, and rouse you from your indifference and sloth!&nbsp;
It is my delight to invite you to Christ; but I feel more
pleasure and more confidence in praying for you to God.&nbsp; I
have besought and entreated you, by every argument and every
motive in my power; but you are yet in your sins, and rushing on
toward hell.&nbsp; Yet I will not give you up in despair.&nbsp;
If I cannot persuade you to flee from the wrath to come, I will
intercede with God to have mercy upon you for the sake of his
beloved Son.&nbsp; If I cannot prevail in the pulpit, I will try
to prevail at the throne!</p>

THE ASCENSION.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Whom the heaven must receive until the
times of restitution of all things</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Acts iii.
21.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> words are part of St.
Peter&rsquo;s sermon to the people of Jerusalem, on occasion of
the cure of the lame man, at the &ldquo;Beautiful Gate&rdquo; of
the temple, shortly after the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p>This, and the sermon recorded in the preceding chapter, were
perhaps the most effective ever delivered on earth.&nbsp; As the
fruit of Peter&rsquo;s ministry in these two discourses, about
five thousand souls were converted to Christianity. <a

<p>It is recorded, that, on the day of Pentecost, the hearers
&ldquo;were pricked in their hearts, and said unto Peter and the
rest of the apostles&mdash;Men and brethren, what shall we
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; An inquiry which indicates the utmost solicitude
and distress.&nbsp; A sense of sin overwhelmed them, especially
of their guilt in rejecting the Son of God; and they pressed
around the preacher and his colleagues with this earnest
interrogative.</p>
<p>The answer was ready.&nbsp; True ministers of Christ are never
at a loss in answering the inquiries of awakened sinners.&nbsp;
When the Philippian jailer came trembling to Paul and Silas, and
fell down before them, exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;What must I do to
be saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
and thou shalt be saved,&rdquo; was the prompt and appropriate
answer.</p>
<p>So Peter, on the day of Pentecost, when three thousand
conscience-smitten and heart-broken hearers cried out under the
sermon&mdash;&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; immediately
replied&mdash;&ldquo;Repent <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>and be baptized, every one of you,
in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye
shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; for the promise is unto
you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as
many as the Lord our God shall call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so in the sermon whence we have taken our text, when he
saw that the truth had found its way to the understanding, and
the conscience, and the heart&mdash;that many were awakened, and
convinced of sin&mdash;he exhorted them to repentance and faith
in Christ, as the condition of salvation:&mdash;&ldquo;Repent ye,
therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,
when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the
Lord; and he shall send Jesus Christ, who before was preached
unto you; whom the heaven must receive until the times of
restitution of all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctrine of this text is&mdash;the necessity of
Christ&rsquo;s return to heaven till the consummation of his
mediatorial work.</p>
<p>It is generally admitted, that the twenty-second psalm has
particular reference to Christ.&nbsp; This is evident from his
own appropriation of the first verse upon the
cross:&mdash;&ldquo;My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; The title of that psalm is&mdash;&ldquo;Aijeleth
Shahar;&rdquo; which signifies&mdash;A hart, or&mdash;the hind of
the morning.&nbsp; The striking metaphors which it contains are
descriptive of Messiah&rsquo;s peculiar sufferings.&nbsp; He is
the hart, or hind of the morning, hunted by the black prince,
with his hell-hounds&mdash;by Satan, and all his allies.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;dogs,&rdquo; the &ldquo;lions,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;unicorns,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;strong bulls of
Bashan,&rdquo; with their devouring teeth, and their terrible
horns, pursued him from Bethlehem to Calvary.&nbsp; They beset
him in the manger, gnashed upon him in the garden, and wellnigh
tore him to pieces upon the cross.&nbsp; And still they persecute
him in his cause, and in the persons and interests of his
people.</p>
<p>The faith of the church anticipated the coming of Christ,
&ldquo;like a roe or a young hart,&rdquo; with the dawn of the
day promised in Eden; and we hear her exclaiming in the
Canticles&mdash;&ldquo;The voice of my beloved! behold, he
cometh, leaping upon the mountains, and skipping upon the
hills!&rdquo;&nbsp; She heard him announce his advent in the
promise&mdash;&ldquo;Lo, I come to do thy will, O God!&rdquo; and
with prophetic eye, saw him leaping from the mountains of
eternity to the mountains of time, and skipping from hill to hill
throughout the land of Palestine, going about doing good.&nbsp;
In the various types and shadows of the law, she beheld him
&ldquo;standing by the wall, <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>looking forth at the windows,
showing himself through the lattice;&rdquo; and then she
sung&mdash;&ldquo;Until the day break, and the shadows flee away,
turn, my beloved, and be thou like the roe or the young hart upon
the mountains of Bether!&rdquo;&nbsp; Bloody sacrifices revealed
him to her view, going down to the &ldquo;vineyards of red
wine;&rdquo; whence she traced him to the meadows of gospel
ordinances, where &ldquo;he feedeth among the
lilies&rdquo;&mdash;to &ldquo;the gardens of cucumbers,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the beds of spices;&rdquo; and then she sung to him
again&mdash;&ldquo;Make haste&rdquo;&mdash;or, flee
away&mdash;&ldquo;my beloved! be thou like the roe or the young
hart upon the mountains of spices!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus she longed to see him, first &ldquo;on the mountain of
Bether,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;on the mountain of
spices.&rdquo;&nbsp; On both mountains she saw him eighteen
hundred years ago, and on both she may still trace the footsteps
of his majesty and his mercy.&nbsp; The former he hath tracked
with his own blood, and his path upon the latter is redolent of
frankincense and myrrh.</p>
<p>Bether signifies division.&nbsp; This is the craggy mountain
of Calvary; whither the &ldquo;Hind of the morning&rdquo; fled,
followed by all the wild beasts of the forest, and the
hunting-dogs of hell; summoned to the pursuit, and urged on, by
the prince of perdition; till the victim, in his agony, sweat
great drops of blood&mdash;where he was terribly crushed between
the cliffs, and dreadfully mangled by sharp and ragged
rocks&mdash;where he was seized by Death, the great greyhound of
the bottomless pit&mdash;whence he leaped the precipice, without
breaking a bone; and sunk in the dead sea, sunk to its utmost
depth, and saw no corruption.</p>
<p>Behold the &ldquo;Hind of the morning&rdquo; on that dreadful
mountain!&nbsp; It is the place of skulls, where death holds his
carnival in companionship with worms, and hell laughs in the face
of heaven.&nbsp; Dark storms are gathering there&mdash;convolving
clouds, charged with no common wrath.&nbsp; Terrors set
themselves in battle-array before the Son of God; and tempests
burst upon him, which might sweep all mankind in a moment to
eternal ruin.&nbsp; Hark! hear ye not the subterranean
thunder?&nbsp; Feel ye not the tremor of the mountain?&nbsp; It
is the shock of Satan&rsquo;s artillery, playing upon the Captain
of our salvation.&nbsp; It is the explosion of the magazine of
vengeance.&nbsp; Lo, the earth is quaking, the rocks are rending,
the graves are opening, the dead are rising, and all nature
stands aghast at the conflict of divine mercy with the powers of
darkness.&nbsp; One dread convulsion <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>more, one cry of desperate agony,
and Jesus dies&mdash;an arrow has entered into his heart.&nbsp;
Now leap the lions, roaring, upon their prey; and the bulls of
Bashan are bellowing; and the dogs of perdition are barking; and
the unicorns toss their horns on high; and the devil, dancing
with exultant joy, clanks his iron chains, and thrusts up his
fettered hands in defiance toward the face of Jehovah!</p>
<p>Go a little farther upon the mountain, and you come to
&ldquo;a new tomb hewn out of the rock.&rdquo;&nbsp; There lies a
dead body.&nbsp; It is the body of Jesus.&nbsp; His disciples
have laid it down in sorrow, and returned weeping to the
city.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s heart is broken, Peter&rsquo;s zeal is
quenched in tears, and John would fain lie down and die in his
Master&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; The sepulchre is closed up and
sealed, and a Roman sentry placed at its entrance.&nbsp; On the
morning of the third day, while it is yet dark, two or three
women come to anoint the body.&nbsp; They are debating about the
great stone at the mouth of the cave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who shall roll
it away?&rdquo; says one of them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pity we did not
bring Peter or John with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; But arriving, they find
the stone already rolled away, and one sitting upon it, whose
countenance is like lightning, and whose garments are white as
the light.&nbsp; The steel-clad, iron-hearted soldiers lie around
him, like men slain in battle, having swooned with terror.&nbsp;
He speaks:&mdash;&ldquo;Why seek ye the living among the
dead?&nbsp; He is not here; he is risen; he is gone forth from
this cave victoriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is even so; for there are the shroud, and the napkin, and
the heavenly watchers; and when he awoke, and cast off his
grave-clothes, the earthquake was felt in the city, and jarred
the gates of hell.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Hind of the morning&rdquo; is
up earlier than any of his pursuers, &ldquo;leaping upon the
mountains, and skipping upon the hills.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is seen
first with Mary at the tomb; then with the disciples in
Jerusalem; then with two of them on the way to Emmaus; then going
before his brethren into Galilee; and finally, leaping from the
top of Olivet to the hills of Paradise; fleeing away to
&ldquo;the mountains of spices,&rdquo; where he shall never more
be hunted by the black prince and his hounds.</p>
<p>Christ is perfect master of gravitation, and all the laws of
nature are obedient to his will.&nbsp; Once he walked upon the
water, as if it were marble beneath his feet; and now, as he
stands blessing his people, the glorious form so recently nailed
to the cross, and still more recently cold in the grave, begins
to ascend like &ldquo;the living <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>creature&rdquo; in Ezekiel&rsquo;s
vision, &ldquo;lifted up from the earth,&rdquo; till nearly out
of sight; when &ldquo;the chariots of God, even thousands of
angels,&rdquo; receive him, and haste to the celestial city,
waking the thrones of eternity with this jubilant
chorus&mdash;&ldquo;Lift up your heads, O ye gates! and be ye
lifted up, ye everlasting doors! and the King of glory shall come
in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ might have rode in a chariot of fire all the way from
Bethlehem to Calvary; but he preferred riding in a chariot of
mercy, whose lining was crimson, and whose ornament the
malefactor&rsquo;s cross.&nbsp; How rapidly rolled his wheels
over the hills and the plains of Palestine, gathering up
everywhere the children of affliction, and scattering blessings
like the beams of the morning!&nbsp; Now we find him in Cana of
Galilee, turning water into wine; then treading the waves of the
sea, and hushing the roar of the tempest; then delivering the
demoniac of Gadara from the fury of a legion of fiends; then
healing the nobleman&rsquo;s son at Capernaum; raising the
daughter of Jairus, and the young man of Nain; writing upon the
grave at Bethany&mdash;&ldquo;I am the resurrection and the
life;&rdquo; curing the invalid at the pool of Bethesda; feeding
the five thousand in the wilderness; preaching to the woman by
Jacob&rsquo;s well; acquitting the adulteress, and shaming her
accusers; and exercising everywhere, in all his travels, the
three offices of Physician, Prophet, and Saviour, as he drove on
toward the place of skulls.</p>
<p>Now we see the chariot surrounded with enemies&mdash;Herod,
and Pilate, and Caiaphas, and the Roman soldiers, and the
populace of Jerusalem, and thousands of Jews who have come up to
keep the Passover, led on by Judas and the devil.&nbsp; See how
they rage and curse, as if they would tear him from his chariot
of mercy.&nbsp; But Jesus maintains his seat, and holds fast the
reins, and drives right on through the angry crowd, without
shooting an arrow, or lifting a spear upon his foes.&nbsp; For in
that chariot the King must ride to Calvary&mdash;Calvary must be
consecrated to mercy for ever.&nbsp; He sees the cross planted
upon the brow of the hill, and hastens forward to embrace
it.&nbsp; No sacrifice shall be offered to Justice on this day,
but the one sacrifice which reconciles heaven and earth.&nbsp;
None of those children of Belial shall suffer to-day.&nbsp; The
bribed witnesses, and clamorous murderers, shall be
spared&mdash;the smiters, the scourgers, the spitters, the
thorn-platters, the nail-drivers, the head-shakers for Jesus
pleads on their behalf&mdash;&ldquo;Father, forgive them! they <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>know not
what they do.&nbsp; They are ignorant of thy truth and
grace.&nbsp; They are not aware whom they are crucifying.&nbsp;
O, spare them!&nbsp; Let Death know that he shall have enough to
do with me to-day!&nbsp; Let him open all his batteries upon
me!&nbsp; My bosom is bare to the stroke!&nbsp; I will gather all
the lances of hell in my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the chariot rushes on, and &ldquo;fiery darts&rdquo; are
falling thick and fast, like a shower of meteors, on
Messiah&rsquo;s head, till he is covered with wounds, and the
blood flows down his garments, and leaves a crimson track behind
him.&nbsp; As he passes, he casts at the dying malefactor a
glance of benignity, and throws him a passport into Paradise,
written with his own blood; stretches forth his scepter, and
touches the prison-door of death, and many of the prisoners come
forth, and the tyrant shall never regain his dominion over them;
rides triumphant over thrones and principalities, and crushes
beneath his wheels the last enemy himself, and leaves the
memorial of his march engraven on the rocks of Golgotha!</p>
<p>Christ is everywhere in the Scriptures spoken of as a
blessing; and whether we contemplate his advent, his ministry,
his miracles, his agony, his crucifixion, his interment, his
resurrection, or his ascension, we may truly say, &ldquo;all his
paths drop fatness.&rdquo;&nbsp; All his travels were on the road
of mercy; and trees are growing up in his footsteps, whose fruit
is delicious food, and whose &ldquo;leaves are for the healing of
the nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; He walketh upon the south winds,
causing propitious gales to blow upon the wilderness, till songs
of joy awake in the solitary place, and the desert blossoms as
the rose.</p>
<p>If we will consider what the prophets wrote of Messiah, in
connection with the evangelical history, we shall be satisfied
that none like him, either before or since, ever entered our
world, and departed from it.&nbsp; Both God and man&mdash;at once
the Father of eternity and the son of time&mdash;he filled the
universe, while he was imbodied upon earth; and ruled the
celestial principalities and powers, while he wandered&mdash;a
persecuted stranger&mdash;in Judea.&nbsp; &ldquo;No man,&rdquo;
saith he, &ldquo;hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came
down from heaven&mdash;even the Son of man, who is in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heaven was no strange place to Jesus.&nbsp; He talks of the
mansions in his Father&rsquo;s house as familiarly as one of the
royal family would talk of Windsor Castle, where he was born; and
saith to his disciples&mdash;&ldquo;I go to prepare a place for
you; that where I am, there <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>ye may be also.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
glory into which he entered was his own glory&mdash;the glory
which he had with the Father before the world was.&nbsp; He had
an original and supreme right to the celestial mansions; and he
acquired a new and additional claim by his office as
mediator.&nbsp; Having suffered for our sins, he &ldquo;ought to
enter into his glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; He ought, because he is
&ldquo;God, blessed for ever&rdquo;&mdash;he ought, because he is
the representative of his redeemed people.&nbsp; He has taken
possession of the kingdom in our behalf, and left on record for
our encouragement this cheering promise&mdash;&ldquo;To him that
overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne; even as I
also have overcome, and am set down with my Father in his
throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The departure of God from Eden, and the departure of Christ
from the earth, were two of the sublimest events that ever
occurred, and fraught with immense consequences to our
race.&nbsp; When Jehovah went out from Eden, he left a curse upon
the place for man&rsquo;s sake, and drove out man before him into
an accursed earth.&nbsp; But when Jesus ascended from Olivet, he
lifted the curse with him, and left a blessing behind
him&mdash;sowed the world with the seed of eternal blessings;
&ldquo;and instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree; and
instead of the briar shall come up the myrtle-tree; and it shall
be to the Lord for a name, and an everlasting sign, that shall
not be cut off.&rdquo;&nbsp; He ascended to intercede for
sinners, and reopen paradise to his people; and when he shall
come the second time, according to the promise, with all his holy
angels, then shall we be &ldquo;caught up to meet the Lord in the
air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord is gone up with a shout,&rdquo; and has taken
our redeemed nature with him.&nbsp; He is the head of the church,
and her representative at the right hand of the Father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He hath ascended on high; he hath led captivity captive;
he hath received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also,
that God may dwell among them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Him hath God
exalted, with his own right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour,
to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is the Father&rsquo;s recognition of his &ldquo;Beloved
Son,&rdquo; and significant acceptance of his sacrifice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him
a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every
knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in the earth,
and things under the earth; and that every <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>tongue
should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evidence of our Lord&rsquo;s ascension is ample.&nbsp; He
ascended in the presence of many witnesses, who stood gazing
after him till a cloud received him out of their sight.&nbsp; And
while they looked steadfastly toward heaven, two angels appeared
to them, and talked with them of what they had seen.&nbsp; Soon
afterward, on the day of Pentecost, he fulfilled, in a remarkable
manner, the promise which he had made to his
people:&mdash;&ldquo;If I go away, I will send you another
Comforter, who shall abide with you for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Stephen, the first of his disciples that glorified the Master by
martyrdom, testified to his murderers&mdash;&ldquo;Lo, I see the
heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of
God!&rdquo;&nbsp; And John, &ldquo;the beloved disciple,&rdquo;
while an exile &ldquo;in Patmos, for the word of God, and the
testimony of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; beheld him &ldquo;in the midst
of the throne, as a Lamb that had been slain!&rdquo;&nbsp; These
are the evidences that our Lord is in heaven; these are our
consolations in the house of our pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The apostle speaks of the <i>necessity</i> of this
event:&mdash;&ldquo;Whom the heaven <i>must</i>
receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Divine necessity is a golden chain, reaching from eternity to
eternity, and encircling all the events of time.&nbsp; It
consists of many links, all hanging upon each other; and not one
of them can be broken, without destroying the support of the
whole.&nbsp; The first link is in God, &ldquo;before the world
was;&rdquo; and the last is in heaven, when the world shall be no
more.&nbsp; Christ is its Alpha and Omega, and Christ constitutes
all its intervenient links.&nbsp; Christ in the bosom of the
Father, receiving the promise of eternal life, before the
foundation of the world, is the beginning; Christ in his
sacrificial blood, atoning for our sins, and pardoning and
sanctifying all them that believe, is the middle; and Christ in
heaven, pleading the merit of his vicarious sufferings, making
intercession for the transgressors, drawing all men unto himself,
presenting the prayers of his people, and preparing their
mansions, is the end.</p>
<p>There is a necessity in all that Christ has done as our
Mediator, in all that he is doing on our behalf, and all that he
has engaged to do&mdash;the necessity of Divine love manifested,
of Divine mercy exercised, of Divine purposes accomplished, of
Divine covenants fulfilled, of Divine faithfulness maintained, of
Divine justice satisfied, <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>of Divine holiness vindicated, and
of Divine power displayed, Christ felt this necessity while he
tabernacled among us, often declared it to his disciples, and
acknowledged it to the Father in the agony of the garden.</p>
<p>Behold him wrestling in prayer, with strong crying and
tears:&mdash;&ldquo;Father, save me from this hour!&nbsp; If it
be possible, let this cup pass from me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the
Father reads to him his covenant engagement, which he signed and
sealed with his own hand before the foundation of the
world.&nbsp; The glorious Sufferer replies:&mdash;&ldquo;Thy will
be done!&nbsp; For this cause came I unto this hour.&nbsp; I will
drink the cup which thou hast mingled, and not a dreg of any of
its ingredients shall be left for my people.&nbsp; I will pass
through the approaching dreadful night, under the hidings of thy
countenance, bearing away the curse from my beloved.&nbsp;
Henceforth, repentance is hidden from mine eyes!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, on his knees, he reads the covenant engagements of the
Father, and adds:&mdash;&ldquo;I have glorified thee on the
earth.&nbsp; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to
do.&nbsp; Now glorify thou me, according to thy promise, with
thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the
world was.&nbsp; Father, I will also that they whom thou hast
given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my
glory.&nbsp; Thine they were, and thou hast given them to me, on
condition of my pouring out my soul unto death.&nbsp; Thou hast
promised them, through my righteousness and meritorious
sacrifice, the kingdom of heaven, which I now claim on their
behalf.&nbsp; Father, glorify my people, with him whom thou
lovedst before the foundation of the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intercession of Christ for his saints, begun on earth, is
continued in heaven.&nbsp; This is our confidence and joy in our
journeyings through the wilderness.&nbsp; We know that our Joshua
has gone over into the land of our inheritance, where he is
preparing a place of habitation for Israel, for it is his will
that all whom he has redeemed should be with him for ever!</p>
<p>The text speaks of the period when the great purposes of our
Lord&rsquo;s ascension shall be fully
accomplished:&mdash;&ldquo;until the times of restitution of all
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The period here mentioned is &ldquo;the dispensation of the
fulness of time,&rdquo; when &ldquo;the fulness of the gentiles
shall come in,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the dispersed of Judah&rdquo;
shall be restored, and Christ shall &ldquo;gather together in
himself all things in heaven and in earth,&rdquo; overthrow his
<a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>enemies,
establish his everlasting kingdom, deliver the groaning creation
from its bondage, glorify his people with himself, imprison the
devil and his angels in the bottomless pit, and punish with
destruction from his presence them that obey not the gospel.</p>
<p>To this glorious consummation, the great travail of
redemption, and all the events of time, are only
preparatory.&nbsp; It was promised in Eden, and the promise was
renewed and enlarged to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&nbsp; It
was described in gorgeous oriental imagery by Isaiah, and
&ldquo;the sweet psalmist of Israel;&rdquo; and &ldquo;spoken of
by all the prophets, since the world began.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christ
came into the world to prepare the way for his future
triumph&mdash;to lay on Calvary the &ldquo;chief
corner-stone&rdquo; of a temple, which shall be completed at the
end of time, and endure through all eternity.&nbsp; He began the
great restitution.&nbsp; He redeemed his people with a price, and
gave them a pledge of redemption by power.&nbsp; He made an end
of sin, abolished the Levitical priesthood, and swallowed up all
the types and shadows in himself.&nbsp; He sent home the beasts,
overthrew the altars, and quenched the holy fire; and, upon the
sanctifying altar of his own divinity, offered his own sinless
humanity, which was consumed by fire from heaven.&nbsp; He
removed the seat of government from Mount Zion in Jerusalem, to
Mount Zion above, where he sits&mdash;&ldquo;a priest upon his
throne&rdquo;&mdash;drawing heaven and earth together, and
establishing &ldquo;the covenant of peace between them
both.&rdquo;&nbsp; Blessed be God! we can now go to Jesus, the
mediator; passing by millions of angels, and all the spirits of
just men made perfect; till we &ldquo;come to the blood of
sprinkling, which speaketh better things than that of
Abel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we look for that blessed day, when
&ldquo;this gospel of the kingdom&rdquo; shall be universally
prevalent; &ldquo;and all shall know the Lord, from the least
even to the greatest&rdquo;&mdash;when there shall be &ldquo;a
new heaven, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness&rdquo;&mdash;when both the political and the moral
aspects of our world shall be changed; and a happier state of
things shall exist than has ever been known before&mdash;when the
pestilence, the famine, and the sword shall cease to destroy; and
&ldquo;the saints of the Most High shall possess the
kingdom,&rdquo; in &ldquo;quietness and assurance for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then cometh the end,&rdquo; when
Emmanuel &ldquo;shall destroy in this mountain the vail of the
covering cast over all people, and swallow up death in
victory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what will it avail you to hear of this glorious
restitution, if <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>you are not partakers of its incipient benefits, and
happily interested in its consummation?&nbsp; Has it begun in
your own hearts?&nbsp; Are you restored to God in Christ?&nbsp;
Have you a place in his house, and a name among his people?&nbsp;
Are your feet running the way of his commandments, and your hands
diligent in doing his work?&nbsp; If not, &ldquo;it is high time
to awake out of sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Repent and believe the
gospel!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the wicked forsake his way, and
the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the
Lord, who will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will
abundantly pardon!&rdquo;</p>

216</span>SERMON XV.<br />
TRIBULATION CONQUERED.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>These things have I spoken unto you</i>,
<i>that in me ye might have peace</i>.&nbsp; <i>In the world ye
shall have tribulation</i>; <i>but be of good cheer</i>; <i>I
have overcome the world</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;John xvi. 33.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last sayings of those we love
are not soon forgotten.&nbsp; These words form the conclusion of
our Lord&rsquo;s valedictory to his disciples.&nbsp; They did not
yet understand that the redemption of man was to be obtained by
the death of their Master.&nbsp; When Christ was put to death, he
descended to the lower parts of the earth, in order to raise up
sinners; but their faith could not follow him into the
deep.&nbsp; Nicholas Pisces sunk into the sea to raise a golden
cup, but neither he nor the cup ever came up again.&nbsp; A man
clothed in glass went down to prepare for raising the Royal
George; the man came up, but the ship remains in the
bottom.&nbsp; But our blessed Redeemer, clothed in humanity,
descended to the deeps of death, and raised the church from the
pit of perdition, and founded her upon a rock, against which the
gates of hell cannot prevail.</p>
<p>We would notice, <i>first</i>, the peace that is in Christ, in
opposition to the tribulation that is in the world; and
<i>secondly</i>, the victory of Christ over the world, as the
source of comfort and joy to believers.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; &ldquo;These things have I spoken unto you, that in
me ye might have peace.&nbsp; I know what you will have in the
world&mdash;mountains of tribulation&mdash;nothing but
tribulation.&nbsp; I will put my peace in the other end of the
scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peace in Christ is &ldquo;the peace of God which passeth all
understanding&rdquo;&mdash;an ocean sufficiently deep and large
to swallow up millions of fiery mountains.&nbsp; See the awakened
sinner, overwhelmed with the terrors of God.&nbsp; His inflexible
justice and spotless holiness <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>seem to him like a mountain of
flame, which he cannot approach without being consumed.&nbsp; But
the Holy Spirit shows him the reconciling blood of the
cross.&nbsp; He sees the crucified God-man rising from the grave,
and ascending on high, &ldquo;to be a Prince and a Saviour, to
give repentance and remission of sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; Instantly the
terrible mountain sinks and is lost in the sea of his
Redeemer&rsquo;s merit.&nbsp; His faith has conquered his
fears.&nbsp; His burden of guilt is gone.&nbsp; He is a new
creature in Christ Jesus, and in Christ Jesus there is no
condemnation.&nbsp; The deluge of tribulation may swell and roar
around him, but he is securely enclosed in the ark.</p>
<p>A man in a trance saw himself locked up in a house of steel,
through the walls of which, as through walls of glass, he could
see his enemies assailing him with swords, spears, and bayonets;
but his life was safe, for his fortress was locked within.&nbsp;
So is the Christian secure amid the assaults of the world.&nbsp;
His &ldquo;life is hid with Christ in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The psalmist prayed&mdash;&ldquo;When my heart is overwhelmed
within me, lead me to the Rock that is higher than
I.&rdquo;&nbsp; Imagine a man seated on a lofty rock in the midst
of the sea, where he has every thing necessary for his support,
shelter, safety, and comfort.&nbsp; The billows heave and break
beneath him, and the hungry monsters of the deep wait to devour
him; but he is on high, above the rage of the former, and the
reach of the latter.&nbsp; Such is the security of faith.</p>
<p>But why need I mention the rock and the steel house? for the
peace that is in Christ is a tower ten thousand times stronger,
and a refuge ten thousand times safer.&nbsp; Behold the disciples
of Jesus exposed to famine, nakedness, peril, and
sword&mdash;incarcerated in dungeons; thrown to wild beasts;
consumed in the fire; sawn asunder; cruelly mocked and scourged;
driven from friends and home, to wander among the mountains, and
lodge in dens and caves of the earth; being destitute, afflicted,
tormented; sorrowful, but always rejoicing; cast down, but not
destroyed; an ocean of peace within, which swallows up all their
sufferings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither death,&rdquo; with all its terrors; &ldquo;nor
life,&rdquo; with all its allurements; &ldquo;nor things
present,&rdquo; with all their pleasure; &ldquo;nor things to
come,&rdquo; with all their promise; &ldquo;nor height&rdquo; of
prosperity; &ldquo;nor depth&rdquo; of adversity; &ldquo;nor
angels&rdquo; of evil; &ldquo;nor principalities&rdquo; of
darkness; &ldquo;shall be able to separate us from the <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God is our
refuge and strength; a very present help in trouble.&nbsp;
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the
sea&mdash;though the waters thereof roar and be
troubled&mdash;though the mountains shake with the swelling
thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the language of strong faith in the
peace of Christ.&nbsp; How is it with you amid such turmoil and
commotion?&nbsp; Is all peaceful within?&nbsp; Do you feel secure
in the name of the Lord, as in a strong fortress&mdash;as in a
city well supplied and defended?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad
the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most
high.&nbsp; God is in the midst of her; she shall not be
moved.&nbsp; God shall help her, and that right
early.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Unto the upright, there ariseth light
in the darkness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bright and morning star,
shining upon their pathway, cheers them in their journey home to
their Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; And when they come to pass over
Jordan, the Sun of Righteousness shall have risen upon them, with
healing in his wings.&nbsp; Already they see the tops of the
mountains of immortality, gilded with his beams, beyond the
valley of the shadow of death.&nbsp; Behold, yonder, old Simeon
hoisting his sails, and saying&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, now lettest
thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine
eyes have seen thy salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the peace of
Jesus, sealed to all them that believe, by the blood of his
cross.</p>
<p>When we walk through the field of battle, slippery with blood,
and strewn with the bodies of the slain&mdash;when we hear the
shrieks and the groans of the wounded and the dying&mdash;when we
see the country wasted, cities burned, houses pillaged, widows
and orphans wailing in the track of the victorious army, we
cannot help exclaiming&mdash;O, what a blessing is peace!&nbsp;
When we are obliged to witness family turmoils and
strifes&mdash;when we see parents and children, brothers and
sisters, masters and servants, husbands and wives, contending
with each other like tigers&mdash;we retire as from a smoky
house, and exclaim as we go&mdash;O, what a blessing is
peace!&nbsp; When duty calls us into that church, where envy and
malice prevail, and the spirit of harmony is supplanted by
discord and contention&mdash;when we see brethren, who ought to
be bound together in love, full of pride, hatred, confusion, and
every evil work&mdash;we quit the unhallowed scene with painful
feelings of repulsion, repeating the exclamation&mdash;O, what a
blessing is peace!</p>
<p><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>But
how much more precious in the case of the awakened sinner!&nbsp;
See him standing, terror-stricken, before mount Sinai.&nbsp;
Thunders roll above him&mdash;lightnings flash around
him&mdash;the earth trembles beneath him, as if ready to open her
mouth and swallow him up.&nbsp; The sound of the trumpet rings
through his soul&mdash;&ldquo;Guilty! guilty!
guilty!&rdquo;&nbsp; Pale and trembling, he looks eagerly around
him, and sees nothing but revelations of wrath.&nbsp; Overwhelmed
with fear and dismay, he cries out&mdash;&ldquo;O wretched man
that I am!&nbsp; Who shall deliver me!&nbsp; What shall I
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; A voice reaches his ear&mdash;penetrates his
heart&mdash;&ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the
sin of the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; He turns his eyes to
Calvary.&nbsp; Wonderous vision!&nbsp; Emmanuel expiring upon the
cross! the sinner&rsquo;s Substitute satisfying the demand of the
law against the sinner!&nbsp; Now all his fears are hushed, and
rivers of peace flow into his soul.&nbsp; This is the peace of
Christ.</p>
<p>How precious is this peace, amid all the dark vicissitudes of
life!&nbsp; How invaluable this jewel, through all the dangers of
the wilderness!&nbsp; How cheering to know that Jesus, who hath
loved us even unto death, is the pilot of our perilous voyage;
that he rules the winds and the waves, and can hush them to
silence at his will, and bring the frailest bark of faith to the
desired haven!&nbsp; Trusting where he cannot trace his
Master&rsquo;s footsteps, the disciple is joyful amid the darkest
dispensations of Divine Providence; turning all his sorrows into
songs, and all his tribulations into triumphs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee,
because he trusteth in thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The victory of Christ over the world, the source of
comfort and joy to believers.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the world ye shall
have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The world is the great castle of Belial, containing three
temples; &ldquo;the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and
the pride of life;&rdquo; in one or another of which every
unconverted soul is a worshipper.&nbsp; But Jesus has demolished
that castle, and abolished the service of its several
temples.</p>
<p>The world has two modes of warfare.&nbsp; Sometimes it puts on
the apparent mildness of a lamb, and allures to destruction with
the song of a siren.&nbsp; Again it leaps upon its prey like an
angry lion, or pursues its victim like an exasperated
dragon.&nbsp; Its frown has destroyed thousands; its smile, tens
of thousands.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>A
certain man has laid it down as a rule, that all must take the
world as it is.&nbsp; But all general rules have their
exceptions.&nbsp; Christ is the exception here.&nbsp; Christ
conquered the world.&nbsp; The Prince of this world met him in
the wilderness, when he was alone, in poverty and
distress&mdash;weary, hungry, and thirsty&mdash;and offered him
all the kingdoms of the world, for which have been fought so many
battles.&nbsp; But Jesus refused the offer; choosing rather to be
poor, that we might be made rich.&nbsp; He detected the lion in
his affectation of the lamb, and stripped from the angel of
darkness his garment of light.</p>
<p>Then the enemy assumed another aspect&mdash;assailed him with
the rage of a wild beast, and the malice of a fiend.&nbsp; No
sooner had he preached his first sermon, than there was an
attempt to hurl him down the precipice.&nbsp; &ldquo;The archers
sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Judea became to him a mountain of leopards, and humanity seemed
infernalized.&nbsp; He was stigmatized as a hypocrite&mdash;an
impostor&mdash;a demoniac.&nbsp; He was falsely accused before
rulers, and insult was added to perjury.&nbsp; &ldquo;But his bow
abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by
the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
tempted in all things like as we are, yet without
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He did no iniquity, neither was guile
found in his mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went through the wilderness
without contracting any of its defilement.</p>
<p>But this was comparatively a small part of his victory.&nbsp;
A more glorious conquest of the world was achieved by his death
upon the cross, and his resurrection from the grave.&nbsp; It is
here we behold him &ldquo;glorious in his apparel, traveling in
the greatness of his strength,&rdquo; trampling the hosts of
hell, till his raiment is red with blood.&nbsp; It is here we
behold him &ldquo;spoiling principalities and powers, and making
a show of them openly&mdash;triumphing over them&rdquo; in his
atonement.&nbsp; It is here we behold the Prince of this world
cast out and judged.&nbsp; The Prince of Peace has broken his
sceptre, demolished his throne, and established upon the ruins of
his empire an everlasting kingdom of grace.</p>
<p>Caiaphas rejoiced that Christ was under the king&rsquo;s seal
in the grave; but his unholy joy was brief as &ldquo;the
crackling of thorns under a pot.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the dawning of
the third day, C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s seal is broken, the stone
rolled away, the tomb deserted of its occupant, Caiaphas&rsquo;
feast of joy turned to lamentation and mourning, and the <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>eternal
power and Godhead of him whom they crucified engraved for ever on
the rent rocks of Calvary.</p>
<p>Alexander conquered the world, but did not live to enjoy the
fruits of his victory.&nbsp; But the Captain of our salvation,
though he was dead, is alive for evermore.&nbsp; He shall
prosecute his conquests, and put all enemies under his feet, and
retain his dominion for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall see of the
travail of his soul, and be satisfied.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lives to
confer upon his people the riches which he procured for them by
his death.&nbsp; He lives to defend his redeemed, and draw all
men unto himself.&nbsp; He lives to perpetuate in the church the
peace which he bequeathed to her in his last will and
testament.</p>
<p>A servant of Julian the Apostate asked one of the
martyrs&mdash;&ldquo;What is thy God, the carpenter, doing now in
heaven?&rdquo;&nbsp; He answered&mdash;&ldquo;Making a coffin for
thy master!&rdquo;&nbsp; Julian was soon afterward mortally
wounded by an arrow from one of the Scythians.&nbsp; When he was
expiring, he waved his hand sorrowfully, and
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;O Galilean, thou hast
conquered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be of good cheer,&rdquo; therefore, ye trembling
disciples!&nbsp; Christ has vanquished all your enemies.&nbsp; Ye
are more than conquerors, through him that loved you, and gave
himself for you.&nbsp; &ldquo;In those things wherein they were
proud, he was above them.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Pharaoh exulted to
overtake Israel, shut in between Pi-hahiroth and Baal-zephon,
with the sea before them, Jehovah was higher than the
Egyptian.&nbsp; His sight was clearer&mdash;his arm was
stronger&mdash;his purpose was firmer.&nbsp; He said to his
people&mdash;&ldquo;Stand still! you are not able to raise this
rampart.&nbsp; I must do it for you.&nbsp; I will divide the sea,
and lead you through on dry land, and drown those who have
drowned so many of your infants.&nbsp; Every one of them shall
perish, from the king to the last footman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the
Prince of Peace has triumphed over your foes, and you may conquer
through faith in his conquest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatsoever is born of
God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh
the world, even our faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John in the Apocalypse saw the army of the victors&mdash;a
great multitude, out of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples,
and tongues&mdash;standing before the throne, and before the
Lamb; clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and
crying with a loud voice&mdash;&ldquo;Salvation to our God, who
sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb!&rdquo;&nbsp; And one
of the elders asked him&mdash;&ldquo;Who are <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>these, and
whence came they?&rdquo;&nbsp; But so wonderfully were they
changed, since he saw them on earth&mdash;in exile, in prison, in
torture and death&mdash;that he confessed he knew them not.&nbsp;
Then answered the elder&mdash;&ldquo;These are they that came out
of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb.&nbsp; Therefore are they before
the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and
he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.&nbsp; They
shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the
sun light on them, nor any heat.&nbsp; For the Lamb, who is in
the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them
unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, ye saints, shall you &ldquo;overcome by the blood of the
Lamb;&rdquo; &ldquo;for greater is he that is in you than he that
is in the world;&rdquo; and your sorrows shall be lost in
unspeakable joy, and your disgrace in eternal glory!</p>

223</span>SERMON XVI.<br />
THE GLORY OF THE GOSPEL.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>According to the glorious gospel of the
blessed God</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;1 Tim. i. 11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> being of God, and some of his
attributes, are revealed to us by natural religion.&nbsp; The
proof is seen in all his works, commending itself to the reason
and conscience even of pagan nations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because that
which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath
showed it unto them; for the invisible things of him, from the
creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead; so that
they are without excuse, because that when they knew God, they
glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain
in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
darkened.&rdquo; <a name="citation223"></a><a href="#footnote223"
class="citation">[223]</a></p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s sermon in Athens was founded on the revelations
of natural religion:&mdash;&ldquo;Then Paul stood in the midst of
Mars&rsquo; hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in
all things ye are too superstitious; for as I passed by, and
beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription,
<span class="smcap">to the unknown god</span>; whom therefore ye
ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.&nbsp; God that made
the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of
heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
neither is worshipped with men&rsquo;s hands, as though he needed
any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
things; and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to
dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times
before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they
should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and
find him, though he be not far from every one of us; for in him
we live, <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>and move, and have our being; as certain also of your
own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.&rdquo; <a
name="citation224"></a><a href="#footnote224"
class="citation">[224]</a></p>
<p>But natural religion, though it reveals the being and
attributes of God, cannot teach the way of salvation, nor lead us
in the path of holiness.&nbsp; It may excite a thousand fears,
not one of which can it allay; and suggest a thousand questions,
not one of which can it answer.&nbsp; It leaves us, with the
deist, in a region of doubt and perplexity; and neither of its
four oracles&mdash;creation, providence, reason, and
conscience&mdash;can satisfy the soul that inquires, &ldquo;What
must I do to be saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; Its light affords us no
guidance in the path of virtue; no certain indications of duty,
either to God or man.&nbsp; Our understandings are so darkened,
our wills so perverted, our affections so carnal, that we can
depend upon no suggestions of external nature, or of reason and
conscience, for the regulation of our moral conduct.&nbsp; God,
therefore, of his infinite mercy, has given us his written
word&mdash;a perfect rule both of faith and practice&mdash;a law
by which we ought to live, and by which we shall be
judged&mdash;a revelation of the mystery which had been hidden
for ages, but is now made manifest to the saints, dispelling the
fears of conscience, soothing the sorrows of the heart, and
bringing life and immortality to light.</p>
<p>Divine revelation, though infinitely above human reason, does
not in the least oppose it.&nbsp; That God should clearly make
known his will to man, is so far from being contrary to reason,
that we may truly say, nothing is more reasonable.&nbsp; The
deductions of reason from the insufficiency of natural religion
strongly indicate the necessity of such a revelation; and as to
its possibility, we know that there can be no impossibility on
the part of God to give it, and there is no impossibility on the
part of man to receive it.&nbsp; God is able to communicate his
will to his creatures in any way he pleases.&nbsp; He can stamp
it on the mind, and make us know that it is he who speaks to
us.&nbsp; But he has chosen another method.&nbsp; He has given us
a record of his will in the Holy Scriptures.&nbsp; &ldquo;God
who, at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in time past
unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken
unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by
whom also he made the worlds.&nbsp; Therefore we ought to give
the more earnest heed to <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>the things which we have heard, lest
at any time we should let them slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is the gospel the truth of God or not?&nbsp; Much has been
written on this question.&nbsp; The arguments that have been
advanced in support of the affirmative have never been
overthrown, and never can be, by all the skeptics in the
world.&nbsp; The revelation of the method of salvation was given
in the garden of Eden to our first parents.&nbsp; Since that
period great talents have been employed, talents worthy of a
better cause, in ridiculing the Bible; but to very little
purpose.&nbsp; The character of the Book of God stands firm as a
mountain amid the clouds, the thunders, and the whirlwinds; and
all the opposition of infidels and blasphemers, instead of
tarnishing, have only brightened its lustre; and from every trial
through which it has passed, it has come forth as fine gold from
the furnace.&nbsp; The religions of the world, the vices and
virtues of the world, all its wisdom and sagacity, and all its
power and authority, in league with the demons of the pit, have
not been able to destroy the gospel, or stay the wheels of its
chariot.&nbsp; Though they were headed by the prince of
darkness&mdash;the prince of this world&mdash;the prince of the
power of the air, that worked mightily in the children of
disobedience, in Palestine, in Greece and Rome, and all over the
world; yet the gospel has proved triumphant.&nbsp; Its enemies,
human and infernal, may wonder and be amazed at its prosperity;
but let them remember that its author is the living God, and
liveth for ever.&nbsp; Though its ministers have been persecuted
and imprisoned, stoned, sawn asunder, slain with the sword, and
burnt in the flames; yet the word of the Lord is not bound, but
is freely preached in many parts of the world, and its doctrines
and practices maintained in their purity by multitudes of
Christians, notwithstanding the most dreadful attempts that have
been made at different times to corrupt and destroy them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the
flower of grass.&nbsp; The grass withereth and the flower thereof
falleth away; but the word of the Lord endureth for ever.&nbsp;
And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We would now call your attention to the Divine authority of
the gospel, and its characteristic glory.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;the gospel of the blessed
God&rdquo;&mdash;a message from God to man&mdash;a revelation of
God&rsquo;s gracious method of saving sinners through the death
of his Son&mdash;a declaration of his sovereign love <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>and mercy
to the utterly wretched and perishing children of men.&nbsp; It
testifieth of the coming of the promised Messiah; of the glory of
his person as God-man; of the excellency of his offices, as our
Prophet, Priest, and King; the honor which he has conferred upon
the law that we have violated, and the satisfaction which he has
given to the Divine justice that we have insulted.&nbsp; It
records the sufferings and death of Christ, his victory over the
powers of darkness, his resurrection from the grave, his
ascension to glory, his session at the right hand of the Father,
and his intercession for sinners on the ground of his vicarious
sufferings; and predicts his second coming in glory, on the
clouds of heaven, to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>I do not mean to say that there is no other truth necessary to
be preached and believed, but all the truths of Divine revelation
are immediately connected with the doctrine of the cross.&nbsp;
This is the testimony that the Father hath testified of his
Son.&nbsp; This is the glad tidings of great joy which shall be
unto all people.&nbsp; This is the faithful saying, or true
report, that is worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save the chief of sinners.&nbsp; This is
&ldquo;the glorious gospel of the blessed God;&rdquo; emanating
from his spirit, and conducting to his kingdom.&nbsp; Let us
consider the evidences of its Divine authority.</p>
<p>The perfections of God, in some degree, are manifested in all
his works and words; his character is stamped on every thing that
his hands hath formed, and his mouth hath spoken; so that there
is a vast difference between the work and language of God, and
the work and language of men.&nbsp; This is especially the case
in reference to the Christian revelation.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;the
gospel of the blessed God,&rdquo; and bears throughout the
impress of its author.&nbsp; When John saw the Lamb in the midst
of the throne, he had no difficulty in determining that he was a
proper object of adoration and praise.&nbsp; As soon as any one
sees the stone with seven eyes laid before Zerubabel, he knows
that it is not a common stone.&nbsp; When you look to the book of
the firmament, the fingers of the Creator&rsquo;s eternal power
and Godhead are evidently seen in the sun, the moon and the
stars.&nbsp; So, in the Bible, we trace the same Divine
hand.&nbsp; As often as I read it, I see eternity, with its
flaming eye, gazing upon me.&nbsp; It unfolds to me the mysteries
of creation and providence.&nbsp; It informs me who made, and
still sustains and governs the universe.&nbsp; It leads me to the
spring and original cause of all <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>things; and places me immediately
before the eyes of the eternal God; and I find myself, in his
presence, both killed and made alive&mdash;most dreadfully
oppressed, and set at perfect liberty&mdash;sunk in the valley of
repentance and humiliation, and lifted upon the top of
Pisgah&mdash;full of fears, and full of joy&mdash;desiring to
hide myself from his sight, yet wishing to abide in the light of
his countenance for ever!</p>
<p>I see the eye of Omniscience looking out upon me from every
chapter of the Bible&mdash;from every doctrine, every precept,
every promise, every ordinance of the gospel&mdash;penetrating
alike the darkness and the light&mdash;searching me through and
through, till I can hide nothing from its gaze&mdash;giving me a
faithful representation of my conscience and my
heart&mdash;making me hate myself, and confess my uncleanness,
and cry out for the creation of a right spirit within me.&nbsp;
And then I see it looking far into futurity&mdash;discovering,
many hundreds of years beforehand, the smallest circumstances in
the life and death of Jesus, even to the price of his betrayal,
the gall mingled with his drink, and the lot cast for his
vesture.&nbsp; How can I doubt that this is the eye of God?</p>
<p>Again: I see Holiness, Justice, and Truth, gazing upon me from
the very heart of the gospel, like so many eyes of consuming
fire.&nbsp; I tremble before them, like Moses before the burning
bush, or Israel at the base of Sinai.&nbsp; Yet do I wish to
behold this terrible glory, for it is mingled with milder beams
of mercy.&nbsp; I take off my shoes, and approach that I may
contemplate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly, God is in this
place!&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot live in sin under the intense blaze
of his countenance.&nbsp; But here also I find the cleft of the
Rock, even the Rock of Ages, wherein he hides me with his hand,
while he makes all his goodness pass before me, and proclaims to
me his name&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and
gracious, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin, and by
no means clearing the guilty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than a
two-edged sword; piercing to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow; and
discerning&rdquo;&mdash;revealing&mdash;condemning&mdash;correcting&mdash;&ldquo;the
thoughts and intents of the heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; It unlocks my
soul, and sits upon its throne; an infallible judge over all my
secret imaginations, purposes, and feelings; bringing them under
its own perfect law; examining them in the light of spotless
holiness, inflexible justice, and eternal truth.&nbsp; And when I
shrink <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>from the scrutiny, overwhelmed with a sense of my
corruption, and confessing my guilt with a broken and contrite
heart, then it speaks to me of the boundless love of God, and the
infinite merit of Christ; and &ldquo;a still small voice&rdquo;
directs my sight to the holy of holies; where I see, through the
rent vail, the King of Zion, sitting upon his throne of grace,
more glorious than the ancient Shekinah upon the
mercy-seat.&nbsp; I approach with joyful confidence, and find him
invested with my own nature, &ldquo;God manifest in the
flesh,&rdquo; his royal garments red with sacrificial blood; and
again I hear the still small voice&mdash;&ldquo;Thy faith hath
saved thee; go in peace!&rdquo;&nbsp; And when the dark mountains
of tribulation rise up before me, I see their tops gilded with
beams of love; and when I look into the valley of the shadow of
death, I see it brightening with the footsteps of the Son of God;
and when the soul sits solitary and dejected in her mortal
prison, longing for the wings of a dove, that she may fly away
and be at rest, she sees the eyes of her Deliverer looking
through the crevices of the wall, and hears his voice at the
grated window&mdash;&ldquo;Fear not, for I am with thee; be not
dismayed, for I am thy God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the gospel commends itself to my conscience and my heart,
as &ldquo;the gospel of the blessed God.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there
is other, and if possible still stronger, proof of its divinity;
namely, its power to renew the human soul, and reform the human
character.&nbsp; The Earl of Rochester was a great skeptic, and
one of the most witty and sarcastic men of his age.&nbsp; In his
last sickness, he was reading the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah;
where the prophet, in so graphic and touching a manner, describes
the vicarious sufferings of Christ.&nbsp; It scattered all his
deistical doubts, as the sun scatters the mist of the morning;
led him with a broken and believing heart to the atoning Lamb of
God; and converted his death-bed into a vestibule of
heaven.&nbsp; This is not a solitary case.&nbsp; Thousands and
millions have been, in like manner, awakened and converted
through the gospel, and brought to the knowledge of the truth as
it is in Jesus.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;mighty through God, to the
pulling down of strong-holds; casting down imaginations, and
every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of
God; and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience
of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;turning men from darkness to light, and
from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission
of sins, and an inheritance among all them that are sanctified <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>through
faith in Jesus.&nbsp; Matthew at the custom-house, the woman of
Samaria at Jacob&rsquo;s well, the dying malefactor upon the
cross, the penitent jailor at Philippi, the blasphemous
persecutor on the road to Damascus, and three thousand souls
under Peter&rsquo;s preaching at the Pentecost, all found it
&ldquo;the power of God unto salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; And still it
retains its convincing and quickening virtue.&nbsp; Wherever it
is proclaimed in its purity, and accompanied with the power of
the Holy Ghost, proud and hardened sinners are pricked in their
hearts, and forced to cry out&mdash;&ldquo;Men and brethren, what
must we do?&rdquo;&nbsp; It answers the question.&nbsp; It points
to the crucified and saith&mdash;&ldquo;Believe and be
saved!&rdquo;&nbsp; It reconciles the enemy unto God.&nbsp; It
makes the blasphemer a man of prayer, the sensualist a man of
purity, the inebriate a man of sobriety; and where sin abounded,
grace much more abounds.&nbsp; The dead whom Jesus quickened had
no time to inquire into the mysterious process by which the work
was wrought.&nbsp; They sprang instantly into life by the power
of God.&nbsp; Yet the evidence of the change was clear and
incontestible.&nbsp; So it is with the transforming effects of
the gospel.&nbsp; We cannot rationally doubt its power to raise
the soul from death in trespasses and sins.&nbsp; Suppose I have
been long afflicted with a cancer, or have been bitten by a
mad-dog, or a rattlesnake; and I find a sovereign and
instantaneous remedy; but after I am cured, a skeptic calls upon
me, and tries to convince me that the remedy is good for nothing,
insists that it is a cheat lately invented by a villain, demands
of me to prove that such things were used before the deluge, and
asks me a thousand questions about the cure which Solomon could
not answer; how can I look upon such a man as better than a
maniac?&nbsp; I have tried the experiment, and found it
successful; and all his pretended philosophical reasoning rings
in my ears like a sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.&nbsp; The
wisdom of men has invented many remedies for the guilt and the
love of sin; but the vain philosophy of the world has never, like
the gospel, restored a single soul to peace, purity, and
happiness.&nbsp; I can truly say, after the most careful
self-examination, and millions more can testify the same thing,
that the gospel, in the hand of the Spirit of God, has subdued
the love of sin, and quenched the fire of guilt within me; and
has taken away the sting of death, and the terrors of the
grave.&nbsp; If the infidel will allow that I am a sane man, <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>and a man
of truth, what farther proof does he want that this is &ldquo;the
gospel of the blessed God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more: The character of God, as exhibited in the gospel,
is perfect, every way worthy of himself, infinitely above any
original conception of the human mind.&nbsp; The gods of Homer
and Virgil are cruel and revengeful.&nbsp; The god of Mohammed
delights in pollution and crime.&nbsp; The god of Voltaire is a
buffoon, and the god of Paine a tyrant.&nbsp; But the gospel
represents the Deity in his true character, as the concentration
and the fountain of all moral excellence.</p>
<p>All this evidence of the Divine authority of the gospel is
corroborated by an overwhelming array of external proof.&nbsp; It
was certainly written by the men whose names it bears.&nbsp; They
were men of irreproachable character.&nbsp; Their declarations
were confirmed by the testimony of miracles, and the fulfilment
of prophecy.&nbsp; Jesus of Nazareth was crucified on Calvary,
rose from the dead the third day, and ascended to heaven,
according to the Scriptures.&nbsp; These were facts believed by
the primitive Christians, and admitted by their enemies.&nbsp;
They were received with the most perfect confidence by the
immediate successors of the original witnesses; and farther
corroborated by the testimony of neutrals, apostates, and the
most inveterate opponents.&nbsp; The question therefore is
settled; all is admitted that is necessary to prove that the
Christian&rsquo;s gospel is &ldquo;the gospel of the blessed
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;the <i>glorious</i>
gospel&rdquo;&mdash;emphatically and pre-eminently glorious; and
this is our second topic of discourse.</p>
<p>It is a wonderful exhibition of the glory of God&mdash;the
most perfect revelation of the Divine attributes ever granted to
man&mdash;displaying the sovereign mercy of the Father, in the
gift of his beloved Son; the infinite compassion of Christ, in
offering himself upon the cross for our sins; and the gracious
power of the Holy Spirit, in turning us from darkness to light,
and renewing us in righteousness and true holiness after the
image of God.</p>
<p>But it is chiefly from a comparison of the gospel with the
law, both in its dispensation and its character, that we see its
transcendent glory.&nbsp; On this point let us fix our
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ministration of the law brought
the angels from heaven to earth, but the ministration of the
gospel required <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>the incarnation of the God of angels.&nbsp; The
Mediator of the new covenant is Jehovah enshrined in
humanity&mdash;&ldquo;Emmanuel&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God with
us&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God manifest in the
flesh&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the fulness of the Godhead,&rdquo; that
&ldquo;filleth all in all,&rdquo; imbodied and made visible in
the lowly Son of David.</p>
<p>This is the foundation of the apostle&rsquo;s argument, by
which he convicts the despisers of the gospel of greater guilt
than the transgressors of the law.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the word
spoken by angels&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the law given upon
Sinai&mdash;&ldquo;was steadfast, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompense of reward; how shall we
escape&rdquo;&mdash;we who have heard the glad tidings of the
gospel&mdash;&ldquo;if we neglect so great salvation; which at
first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us
by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, with
signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy
Ghost?&rdquo;&nbsp; If God is greater than man, then the gospel
is greater than the law; and its superior excellence constitutes
for it a superior claim upon our faith and our affections; and
the strength of that claim graduates the guilt of its
rejection.&nbsp; There is a fire more intense than that which
flamed on Sinai, and a judgment more terrible than that of Korah
and his confederates.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that despised Moses&rsquo;
law died without mercy, under two or three witnesses; of how much
sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who
hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the
blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and hath done despite to
the Spirit of grace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ceremonial law contained many a type and shadow of
Messiah; but the gospel is the history of his advent and
mediatorial work.&nbsp; The ceremonial law pointed to the coming
Prince of Peace; but the gospel brings him to his throne, and
puts the crown upon his head.&nbsp; Christ is &ldquo;the
brightness of the Father&rsquo;s glory, and the express image of
his person;&rdquo; and Moses and Aaron are lost in his light, as
the moon and the stars in the blaze of the rising sun.&nbsp; The
excellence of his person, the merit of his sacrifice, and the
utility of his offices, give him an immense superiority.&nbsp;
The many prophets, priests, and kings, of the former
dispensation, were but the shadows cast by the one great Prophet,
Priest, and King, which indicated his coming.&nbsp; A light arose
from the cross of Calvary which turned the black cloud on Sinai
into a pillar of glory.</p>
<p>Typical blood shielded the children of Israel from the arm of
the <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>destroying angel, healed the leper, anointed to holy
offices, atoned for ceremonial sins, and sealed the covenant of
God with his people; but never cancelled the sinner&rsquo;s debt,
nor satisfied his conscience, nor sanctified his affections, nor
calmed his trembling spirit in the hour of death.&nbsp; All these
blessings, however, flow from the blood of Christ&mdash;these,
and infinitely more&mdash;more than tongue can tell, or heart
conceive.</p>
<p>The gospel is emphatically the ministration of mercy&mdash;the
covenant of grace, &ldquo;ordered in all things and
sure&rdquo;&mdash;a goodly ship, freighted with the bread of
life, and commanded by the Son of God, who has steered into the
harbor of our famishing world, and is dispensing the precious
provision to all who will accept.&nbsp; These arc &ldquo;the sure
mercies of David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The law is only a partial revelation of the Divine attributes,
which, in the gospel, are all equally exhibited, and all equally
glorified.&nbsp; Here, &ldquo;Mercy and Truth are met together;
Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
justice of God looks more terrible at the cross of Christ than at
the gate of hell; and is more glorified in the sufferings of his
Son than in the eternal agonies of all the damned; while his
mercy is more beautiful, because more honorable to his
administration, than if sinners had been saved without an
atonement.</p>
<p>Thus, while the law reveals the righteousness of God, the
gospel brightens the revelation of his righteousness, and adds
the revelation of his grace.&nbsp; While the law imprisons the
sinner, the gospel liberates him, yet liberates him according to
law.&nbsp; While the law shows the malignity of sin, and dooms
the sinner to death, the gospel assents to both, but conquers the
one and counteracts the other.</p>
<p>The law convinces us of our fall; the gospel assures us of our
redemption.&nbsp; The law shows us what we are, and what we ought
to be; the gospel tells us what we may become, and now the change
must be effected.&nbsp; The law tears open our wounds; the gospel
pours in the healing balm.&nbsp; The law makes known our duty;
the gospel aids us to perform it.&nbsp; The law plunges us in the
ditch; the gospel opens to us the purifying fountain.&nbsp; The
law is a mirror in which we behold our own filthiness and
deformity; the gospel is a mirror which reflects the glory of God
in Christ, and transforms the believer into the same image.</p>
<p>The law has no fellowship with the sinner&mdash;offers no
pardon to <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>the sinner&mdash;cannot cure the love of sin in his
heart&mdash;cannot give a spark of life, without perfect
obedience, and full satisfaction for past offences.&nbsp;
Therefore some accuse the law of cruelty&mdash;cannot set forth
the superior glory of the gospel, without representing the law as
a tyrant or a vagrant.&nbsp; But it is not the cruelty of the
law, but the righteousness of the law, that condemns the
sinner.&nbsp; This is the reason that it has no alms-house, nor
city of refuge, in its dominion.&nbsp; Yet &ldquo;the law is our
schoolmaster, to bring us to Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; By convincing
us of sin, it shows us our need of a Saviour.&nbsp; It meets the
sinner on his way to hell, and drives him back to Calvary!</p>
<p>But the gospel is more glorious.&nbsp; It enters the
sinner&rsquo;s heart, and casts out the love of sin, and scourges
the traffickers from the temple of God.&nbsp; It enters the
prisoner&rsquo;s cell, knocks off his fetters, and bids him go
free.&nbsp; It descends into the valley of dry bones, makes the
mouldering skeletons living men, and leads them to Mount Zion
with songs of everlasting joy.&nbsp; It gives eyes to the blind,
ears to the deaf, feet to the lame, tongues to the dumb, health
to the sick, life to the dead, and revives such as are fainting
under the terrors of the law.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;the power of God
unto salvation to every one that believeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moravian missionaries in Greenland preached several years
on the great doctrines of natural religion, and the requirements
of the moral law, without producing any visible reformation in
their hearers; but under the very first sermon which exhibited
&ldquo;Jesus Christ and him crucified,&rdquo; many were pricked
in their hearts, and led effectually to repentance.</p>
<p>We have a striking illustration of the distinguishing glory of
the gospel&mdash;its mercy&mdash;in the parable of the prodigal
son.&nbsp; The young man, having received his portion from his
Father, went into a far country, and spent all his substance in
drunkenness and debauchery.&nbsp; Reduced to the last extremity
of want, the proud young nobleman hired himself to a citizen of
that country, and became a feeder of swine&mdash;the meanest
employment to which a Jew could be degraded.&nbsp; On the very
verge of starvation, we see him snatching the husks from the
mouths of the detested animals to satisfy his hunger.&nbsp; Now
he contrasts the present with the past.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
father&rsquo;s house!&nbsp; O, my father&rsquo;s
house!&rdquo;&nbsp; A trembling hope springs up in his bosom,
&ldquo;I will arise and go!&rdquo;&nbsp; I see him coming, full
of guilt and shame&mdash;halting&mdash;trembling&mdash;ready to
turn back, or lie down by the wayside <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>and die.&nbsp; While yet a great way
off, the father beholds him&mdash;O, not with an eye of anger and
revenge! and runs to meet him&mdash;O, not with a drawn sword, or
an uplifted rod!&nbsp; He feels within him the yearning of a
father&rsquo;s heart, leaps to embrace the prodigal, and pours
upon him a mingled shower of kisses and tears.&nbsp; Not a
reproachful word is uttered&mdash;not the slightest
censure&mdash;nothing but love.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father, I have
sinned!&nbsp; I am not worthy to be&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Peace, my
son!&nbsp; Servants, bring a robe, a ring, a pair of shoes; and
haste to kill the fatted calf; and let us eat and be merry; for
this my son was dead and is alive, was lost and is
found!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And they began to be merry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such, my brethren, is the unspeakable mercy of the gospel,
which constitutes its distinguishing glory.&nbsp; It is the law
that creates the famine in the &ldquo;far country&rdquo; of
sin.&nbsp; The poor prodigal goes about, begging for bread; but
none will give him a crust, or a crumb.&nbsp; The desert of Mount
Sinai is a poor country for a starving soul.&nbsp; There is no
bread in all that region, and no toleration for beggars.&nbsp; If
the sinner offers to work for any of the citizens&mdash;either
for Mr. Holiness, or Mr. Justice, or Mr. Truth&mdash;he is sent
into the fields to feed swine, till he is thoroughly convinced of
the nakedness of the land, and the misery of his lot; and if he
faints through famine or fatigue, and fails to perform his task,
he is thrust into the house of correction, and placed upon the
tread-wheel of remorse, till the ministers of mercy come to his
relief.&nbsp; It is the gospel that whispers&mdash;&ldquo;Return
to thy father!&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the gospel that inspires the
hope of acceptance.&nbsp; It is the gospel that meets him with
more than paternal welcome, and rains upon him the baptism of
blessings and tears.&nbsp; It is the gospel that brings its robe
of righteousness, and its ring of favour, and spreads its feast
of joy, and calls the angels to merry-making &ldquo;over one
sinner that repenteth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, the love of God!&nbsp; O, the riches of Christ!&nbsp; His
salvation is more than a restoration to the joys of Eden.&nbsp;
He came that we might have life, and that we might have it more
abundantly.&nbsp; Where sin abounded under the law, grace hath
much more abounded under the gospel.&nbsp; It is an ocean of
blessings&mdash;&ldquo;blessings of the heaven above, and of the
deep that lieth under&rdquo;&mdash;the blessings of Jacob,
&ldquo;prevailing above the blessings of his progenitors, unto
the utmost bound of the everlasting hills&rdquo;&mdash;blessings
which cannot be circumscribed by time, passing over the mountains
which now divide us <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>from the promised land, and flowing
down on the other side into the pacific vales of immortality!</p>
<p>Such is &ldquo;the glorious gospel of the blessed
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; You have seen the evidence of its divinity, and
the peculiar excellence of its character.&nbsp; Suffer me to ask,
do you believe its doctrines? do you obey its precepts? do you
enjoy its blessings? do you delight in its promises?&nbsp; It
commends itself every way to your faith, and your
affections.&nbsp; It is worthy of all acceptation.&nbsp; It is
the light of the world&mdash;walk ye in it!&nbsp; It is a feast
for the soul&mdash;eat and be satisfied!&nbsp; It is a river of
living water&mdash;drink and thirst no more!</p>
<p>How miserable is that man who rejects alike its evidences and
its offers!&nbsp; How miserable in the hour of death!&nbsp; As
Thistlewood said of himself, when on the drop at Newgate, he is
&ldquo;taking a leap in the dark!&rdquo;&nbsp; How miserable in
the day of judgment!&nbsp; God saith&mdash;&ldquo;Because I have
called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hands all the day
long, and no man regarded; but ye have set at naught my counsel,
and would none of my reproof; therefore I also will laugh at your
calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh&mdash;when your fear
cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a
whirlwind&mdash;when distress and anguish cometh upon
you!&rdquo;</p>

236</span>SERMON XVII.<br />
THE SONG OF THE ANGELS.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Glory to God in the highest</i>, <i>and
on earth peace</i>, <i>good will toward men</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Luke ii. 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most important event recorded
in the annals of time, is the incarnation of the Son of
God.&nbsp; Anointed to be &ldquo;the Apostle and High Priest of
our profession,&rdquo; it was necessary that he should humble
himself, to assume our degraded nature, and enter into our
suffering condition.&nbsp; Had he appeared on earth in the
unmitigated glory of his Godhead, the children of men could not
have borne the revelation, and could not have been benefited by
his personal ministry; neither could he have been &ldquo;touched
with the feeling of our infirmities,&rdquo; nor have offered
himself a sacrifice for our sins.&nbsp; His manifestation in the
flesh was essential to the great objects of his advent; and no
wonder the heavenly host descended to announce his coming, and
poured forth their delight in this joyful
strain;&mdash;&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us consider, <i>first</i>, The incarnation of the Eternal
Word; and, <i>secondly</i>, The song of the angels on the
occasion of his birth.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Though it is impossible for the immutable God to be
made a creature, yet the Divine nature was so closely and
mysteriously joined to the human, that the same person was
&ldquo;a child born,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Mighty
God&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;a son given,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
Everlasting Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Divinity did not become
humanity, and the humanity did not become Divinity; but the two
were so united as to constitute but one glorious Mediator.</p>
<p>Though his incarnation did not destroy, or even tarnish in the
<a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>least,
the essential glory of the Deity; yet was it a mighty and
marvellous condescension, for him who is &ldquo;over all, God,
blessed for ever,&rdquo; thus to assume our frail and suffering
flesh.&nbsp; Solomon asked&mdash;&ldquo;Will God in very deed
dwell with men upon the earth?&rdquo;&nbsp; A question which
neither men nor angels could answer.&nbsp; But God hath answered
it himself, and answered it in the affirmative.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Word&rdquo; that &ldquo;was in the beginning with God, and was
God,&rdquo; in the fulness of time, &ldquo;was made flesh, and
dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can form no idea of the natural distance between God and
man.&nbsp; But the infinite vacuum is filled up by the
Messiah.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;Emmanuel&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the true
God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Son of Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He
thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of
no reputation, and took upon himself the form of a servant, and
was made in the likeness of sinful flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Passing by
the nobler nature of angels, &ldquo;he took on him the seed of
Abraham.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor did he join himself to humanity in its
original perfection and glory.&nbsp; He came into the mean
condition of fallen creatures, sharing with us our various
infirmities and sufferings.&nbsp; Yet he was free from all moral
contamination.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;holy, harmless, undefiled, and
separate from sinners.&rdquo;&nbsp; He &ldquo;knew no
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; He &ldquo;did no iniquity, neither was guile
found in his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But notwithstanding the humility of his appearance in
Bethlehem, such was the dignity of his person, and such the
magnitude and grandeur of the work for which he came into the
world, that angels descended from heaven to publish the glad
tidings to the children of men.&nbsp; True, no ambassadors were
sent to the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem&mdash;none to the Senate of
Rome, to proclaim the coming of the Prince of Peace; but never
was there such an embassage on earth, to announce the birth of a
royal son, as that which came to the shepherds of
Bethlehem.&nbsp; When he appeared among men, the order was given
in heaven, that all the angels of God should worship him; and
their example was followed by wise men upon earth.&nbsp; The
prophet Isaiah said that his name should be called Wonderful; and
the angel informed Mary that he should be great, and should be
called the Son of the Highest; and that God should give unto him
the throne of his father David, and he should reign over the
house of Jacob for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though he was rich, yet for
our sake <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>he became poor, that we through his poverty might be
rich.&rdquo;&nbsp; He humbled himself that we might be
exalted&mdash;was bruised and wounded that we might be
healed&mdash;died the most shameful death that men could inflict,
that we might live the most glorious life that God can
confer!</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Let us now consider the import of the anthem, sung
by the heavenly host, when he was born in Bethlehem.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
toward men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
shining light between the cherubim, on the mercy-seat, was called
&ldquo;the glory of the Lord,&rdquo; being a supernatural
representation of his presence in the sanctuary.&nbsp; Three of
the apostles saw the same glory upon the mount of
transfiguration, and all believers have seen it by faith.&nbsp;
The word &ldquo;glory,&rdquo; in the anthem of the angels, refers
to the divine honor and praise resulting from the humiliation of
Christ.&nbsp; The redemption of sinners, through the blood of the
cross, and by the grace of the Holy Spirit, is not only
consistent with the glory of God, but highly promotive of his
glory, as our Creator and Lawgiver.&nbsp; It brightens all the
gems previously visible in his crown, and reveals others that
were concealed.&nbsp; His glory, as seen in the works of creation
and providence, is the glory of wisdom, power, and love.&nbsp;
His glory, as seen in his law and its administration, is the
glory of holiness, justice, and truth.&nbsp; These are essential
to his nature and his government.&nbsp; But in the incarnation
and the cross of Christ, we behold a new glory, a glory nowhere
else displayed, the glory of mercy.&nbsp; God was known before to
be the friend of saints, but here he shows himself the friend of
sinners.&nbsp; His character as previously revealed was matter of
admiration and praise in earth and heaven, but this new
revelation occasions new wonder and rejoicing to men and
angels.&nbsp; Angels delighted to bear the joyful news to men,
and this was the burden of their message:&mdash;&ldquo;Behold, we
bring you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be
unto&rdquo;&mdash;the righteous? the benevolent and charitable?
no; but&mdash;&ldquo;unto all people.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what are
these tidings?&nbsp; &ldquo;To you is born, this day, in the city
of David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is
the Lawgiver embracing the rebels; his the glory, theirs the
benefit; while angels participate the joy of both,
singing&mdash;&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &ldquo;On earth peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not by a
compromise with Satan, as he <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>proposed when he tempted the Son of
God in the wilderness.&nbsp; Not at the expense of the Divine
law, but by magnifying and making it honorable.&nbsp; Not a peace
with enmity, for Christ hath slain the enmity by his cross.&nbsp;
Our peace flows from the reconciling blood of Jesus.&nbsp;
Nothing else could satisfy the claims of Divine justice, and
procure pardon for the penitent believer.</p>
<p>Without the atonement, there is no peace for sinners.&nbsp;
There is an accusing witness within.&nbsp; Behold that king in
the banqueting-house!&nbsp; Why changes his countenance?&nbsp;
Why tremble his knees?&nbsp; Have the wise men of Babylon
interpreted the mystic writing upon the wall?&nbsp; No; but
conscience has.&nbsp; Conscience has given dreadful intimations
of its meaning, before Daniel comes into the presence of the
king, and the Hebrew prophet only confirms the previous
interpretation.&nbsp; Every sinner bears about with him that
internal tormentor.&nbsp; It may be bribed; but not for
ever.&nbsp; It may be lulled to sleep; but it will awake with
increased energy, and augmented wrath.&nbsp; The gnawing worm may
be stupified for a season, but cannot be killed.&nbsp; The
devouring fire may be temporarily stifled, but cannot be
quenched.&nbsp; How dreadful are its torments, when it wreaks all
its anger upon the guilty!&nbsp; To be drowned in the Red Sea,
like Pharaoh&mdash;to be swallowed up by the earth, like
Korah&mdash;to be hewn in pieces, like Agag&mdash;to be eaten of
worms, like Herod&mdash;is nothing in the comparison.</p>
<p>Where shall we find peace?&nbsp; We have heard of a stone
which nothing but blood can dissolve.&nbsp; Such a stone is the
human conscience.&nbsp; But all the blood shed on Jewish altars
could never effect the work.&nbsp; It must be the blood of
Jesus.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;the Lamb of God that taketh away the
sin of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; At his cross, the believer&rsquo;s
conscience finds assurance and repose.&nbsp; He is the good
physician, and his blood is the sovereign balm.&nbsp; Come to his
extended arms!&nbsp; Come, for he waits to be gracious!</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good will toward men.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
&ldquo;good will&rdquo; of whom?&nbsp; Of God, blessed for
ever.&nbsp; The funds of a benevolent society may be exhausted,
so that its members in distress can receive no benefit.&nbsp; But
in the &ldquo;good will&rdquo; of God we find unsearchable riches
of grace, sufficient to pay off our whole debt to the law, and
restore our forfeited inheritance; to bring forth the prisoners,
and them that sit in darkness, out of the prison-house; to
support the believer through life, and comfort him in death, and
raise him from the grave not a <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>beggar, or a pensioner, but a
prince, clothed in white, and entitled to an everlasting
kingdom.</p>
<p>Did I possess the nature of angels, with my present
sinfulness, I should have no hope of salvation, for God hath
provided no mercy for fallen angels; but, in his infinite wisdom,
he hath devised a method for the consistent display of his
&ldquo;good will toward men,&rdquo; by assuming their nature, and
in that nature atoning for their sins.&nbsp; This is a wonderful
scheme, whereby God can be just, and yet justify the
ungodly.&nbsp; His law is honoured, though its violater be
acquitted; and his government is secure, though the rebel be
forgiven.</p>
<p>Methinks I hear the Infant in Bethlehem, speaking from the
manger, in the strain of the Evangelical Prophet:&mdash;&ldquo;Is
my hand shortened at all, that I cannot redeem; or have I no
power to deliver?&nbsp; Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea,
and make the rivers a wilderness; I clothe the heavens with
blackness, and make sackcloth their covering.&nbsp; Though ye see
me in human flesh, I am still Lord of all, and can save unto the
uttermost.&nbsp; Though ye do not hear me, I have the tongue of
the learned, to speak a word in season to him that is
weary.&nbsp; I have taken upon myself your nature, that I may be
able to sympathize in your sufferings, and make satisfaction for
your sins.&nbsp; For you will I give my back to the smiters, and
my cheek to them that pluck off the hair; and I will not hide my
face from shame and spitting.&nbsp; Calvary and Joseph&rsquo;s
grave shall manifest my benevolence, and it shall be seen that my
mercy is mightier than death.&nbsp; Who will contend with
me?&nbsp; Let him come near!&nbsp; Let us stand together!&nbsp; I
challenge all the powers of darkness to defeat the purposes of my
grace.&nbsp; I will triumph by suffering.&nbsp; I will dash them
in pieces as a potter&rsquo;s vessel.&nbsp; Hell shall tremble at
the report; and on every gate and door-post, in all my journey
from this place to Golgotha, and thence home to my Father&rsquo;s
house, shall be inscribed the record of my good will toward
men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners.&rdquo;&nbsp; Behold him pressing the wine of eternal
life for us from the cup of his own mortality; demolishing the
kingdom of darkness on earth, and establishing in its stead the
kingdom of heaven; destroying the works of the devil, delivering
the captives from his iron yoke, and uniting sinners to himself
in everlasting fellowship and love.&nbsp; The <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>whole
economy of Divine grace, based on the incarnation of the Son of
God, is like a complicated piece of machinery, consisting of many
wheels, all revolving in harmony, and impelled by the same
power.&nbsp; Salvation is a river, flowing from the manger in
Bethlehem, conveying eternal life to millions, and bearing away
many a precious gem from the dominions of death and hell.&nbsp;
It has already swept from the earth more false gods than would
have filled the Roman Pantheon; and carried multitudes of human
souls, pardoned and purified, to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom.&nbsp; No
opposition of men or devils can stand before &ldquo;the glorious
gospel of the blessed God.&rdquo;&nbsp; O that its light may
shine into the heart and the conscience of every hearer!&nbsp;
May the goodness of God lead you all to repentance, and fill you
with peace in believing!&nbsp; Then will you go forth with joy,
and publish his &ldquo;good will toward men;&rdquo; and when the
purposes of his mercy are accomplished in your hearts, you shall
be removed from grace to glory&mdash;from peace to perfect

THE STONE OF ISRAEL.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Behold the stone that I have laid before
Joshua</i>.&nbsp; <i>Upon one stone shall be seven
eyes</i>.&nbsp; <i>Behold</i>, <i>I will engrave the graving
thereof</i>, <i>saith the Lord of hosts</i>, <i>and I will remove
the iniquity of that land in one day</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Zech. iii.
9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Amid</span> all the tribulations which the
church has suffered, she has ever been preserved and sustained by
the gracious providence of God; like the bush in
Horeb&mdash;burning, yet unconsumed.</p>
<p>In the days of this prophet, the church was feeble and
afflicted.&nbsp; Having just returned from the captivity in
Babylon, by which she had been greatly reduced, she resembled the
myrtle among the oaks, the firs, and the cedars.&nbsp; But the
Messiah appears to the prophet, standing among the myrtle-trees,
and encouraging the children of Israel to proceed in rebuilding
Jerusalem and the temple.&nbsp; The good success of Zerubbabel is
represented by a golden candlestick, with a bowl at the top, and
seven lamps for the light, and seven pipes to convey the oil to
the lamps, and two olive-trees&mdash;one on each
side&mdash;pouring the oil into the pipes.&nbsp; This was
intended also to set forth the relation of Christ to his church,
as her head, and the fountain whence she derives strength and
nourishment, enabling her to grow in grace, and the saving
knowledge of God.&nbsp; As they bring forth the foundation and
the corner-stones with joy, wondering at the Divine goodness and
mercy, Jehovah shows them that he is about to lay in Zion the
foundation and chief corner-stone of a spiritual temple:
&ldquo;Behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua.&nbsp;
Upon one stone shall be seven eyes.&nbsp; Behold I will engrave
the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove
the iniquity of that land in one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>Let
us consider the important truths taught us in this metaphorical
description of Christ and his mediatorial work.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Christ is the foundation and chief corner-stone of
his church.&nbsp; This figure is often used in the Holy
Scriptures.&nbsp; &ldquo;From hence is the Shepherd, the Stone of
Israel&rdquo;&mdash;said Jacob in the blessing of Joseph.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The stone which the builders refused,&rdquo; said the
Psalmist, &ldquo;is become the head-stone of the
corner.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Isaiah said&mdash;&ldquo;Thus saith the
Lord God: Behold, I lay in Zion, for a foundation, a stone, a
tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure
foundation.&rdquo;&nbsp; All these predictions were appropriated
by Messiah, to whom they were intended to apply.&nbsp; Christ is
the foundation and chief corner-stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other
foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye are built upon the foundation of
the apostles and prophets&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the foundation
which they recognized and recommended&mdash;&ldquo;Jesus Christ
himself being the chief corner-stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is indeed
the foundation of the world; and in the fulness of time, was
declared the foundation of the church.&nbsp; All the buildings of
mercy that have ever been erected stand firm and immovable on
this Rock of Ages.</p>
<p>In the architecture of the first covenant in Eden, there was a
Stone under one end, and earth under the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
first man was of the earth, earthy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when the
storm and the flood came, the earth gave way, and the building
fell.&nbsp; But in the architecture of the second covenant upon
Calvary, God laid help upon one that was mighty.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
second man is the Lord from heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; A stone suitable
for the foundation of a royal palace is very valuable, because
the safety of the building depends upon the firmness of the
foundation.&nbsp; This Stone is &ldquo;chosen of God and
precious.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is long and broad enough for the whole
edifice, stretching from eternity to eternity; and sufficiently
strong to sustain it, though millions of living stones be built
into the spiritual temple; and such is its firmness, that time,
with all its storms, shall never destroy it, or injure its
beauty.&nbsp; It is a tried and precious stone, composed of all
that is excellent on earth, and all that is glorious in
heaven&mdash;a sinless specimen of humanity, possessing
&ldquo;all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a
foundation, it is laid deep in the earth; as a corner-stone, it
rises above the stars, and binds the whole building in heaven and
earth together.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; This Stone is &ldquo;laid before
Joshua.&rdquo;&nbsp; God has revealed his <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Son, as the
only foundation, and chief corner-stone, to the wise
master-builders of his church, in every age of the world.&nbsp;
The seed was promised in Eden.&nbsp; Holy men of old beheld the
promises afar off.&nbsp; Abraham desired to see his day; he saw
it, and was glad.&nbsp; This was the foundation of the prophets
and apostles.&nbsp; As Moses found so much of God in the rod that
was in his hand, that he could think of no other means for
working a miracle; so the prophets and apostles saw and felt so
much of Christ in the revelations of which they were made the
media, that they could never think of salvation from sin and hell
but through his meritorious death; and the most dreadful
tortures, and even martyrdom itself, lost their terrors in
&ldquo;the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face
of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Stone was laid also before Wickliff and Luther.&nbsp; The
office and work of Christ had been lost sight of, in the
intercession of saints, and the merit of human works.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;the foundation of God standeth sure;&rdquo; and all the
rubbish which Roman monks had heaped upon it could not hide it
from the reformers, whose vision had been cleared and quickened
by light from heaven.&nbsp; And it was laid before Wesley and
Whitefield in England, who built upon it &ldquo;gold, silver, and
precious stones;&rdquo; and before Powell, Erbery, and
Wroth&mdash;before Rowlands, Harris, Jones, Evans, Thomas, and
Francis&mdash;as the foundation of that wonderful revival in
Wales, the blessed effects of which we feel to this day.</p>
<p>We are now endeavoring to exhibit the glory and excellency of
this Stone, as the foundation of your hopes.&nbsp; Will you build
upon Christ?&nbsp; Can you venture your eternal salvation upon
the merit of his sacrifice?&nbsp; &ldquo;He that believeth on him
shall not be ashamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; It is said that &ldquo;upon one stone shall be
seven eyes;&rdquo; by which we may understand, either seven eyes
of others, looking upon the stone; or seven eyes in the stone,
looking upon others.</p>
<p>If we take the former idea, there are many eyes looking upon
this &ldquo;One Stone;&rdquo; some from envy, malice, and wrath;
others from astonishment, gratitude, and love.&nbsp; It attracts
the gaze of heaven, earth, and hell.&nbsp; The eternal Lawgiver
looks to Messiah for satisfaction on behalf of guilty man.&nbsp;
Mercy and Truth look upon him as the foundation of their
palaces.&nbsp; Righteousness and Peace look upon him as the only
place where they can salute each other with a kiss.&nbsp; The
devil and his angels, sin, death, and the <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>grave, look
upon him with eyes of anger and revenge; determined, if possible,
to bruise him with their weapons, and cast him among the rubbish,
into the pit of corruption.&nbsp; Celestial spirits look upon him
with eyes of wonder and delight; announce his coming to Joseph
and Mary, sing his advent to the shepherds of Judea, accompany
him through all his pilgrimage of sorrow, minister to him after
the temptation in the wilderness, talk with him on the mount of
transfiguration, sustain him in the agony of the garden, gather
unseen around his cross, roll away the rock from the entrance of
his tomb, and attend him with songs as he ascends to glory.&nbsp;
And believers look upon him with eyes of faith and love, as the
foundation of all their hopes, in this world, and that which is
to come&mdash;as their &ldquo;wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other interpretation refers these &ldquo;seven eyes&rdquo;
to the perfection of our Lord&rsquo;s mediatorial
character.&nbsp; The priest under the law was to sprinkle the
blood seven times upon the mercy-seat, and seven times upon the
leper; the first to typify a perfect atonement for sin; the
second, a perfect application of its benefits to the
believer.&nbsp; When the Lamb of God revived from the ashes on
the altar of Calvary, he appeared &ldquo;in the midst of the
throne,&rdquo; having seven horns and seven eyes, to denote the
completeness of his prophetic wisdom, and the fulness of his
regal authority.&nbsp; He sustains to his people the threefold
relation of high-priest, prophet, and king.&nbsp; He is our
high-priest, not after the order of Aaron, whom death robbed of
his sacerdotal vesture; but &ldquo;a high-priest for ever, after
the order of Melchizedec.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is our prophet,
speaking with the tongue of the learned, and as one having
authority&mdash;speaking to the conscience and the heart, and the
dead hear his voice and live.&nbsp; He is our king, according to
the decree, &ldquo;on the holy hill of Zion;&rdquo; exalted by
the right-hand of the Father, and &ldquo;declared to be the Son
of God with power by the resurrection from the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Methinks I hear the Father speaking to
Caiaphas:&mdash;&ldquo;Have you a law, and do you say that by
your law he ought to die?&nbsp; I will read to you the law on the
morning of the third day, and you shall see that he is the
resurrection and the life&mdash;that I have made him both Lord
and Christ!&rdquo;&nbsp; And methinks I hear the voice of the
risen Messiah:&mdash;&ldquo;I have travelled through the forest
of the world&rsquo;s temptations, through the dens of lions, the
<a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>mountains of leopards, the dark haunts of devils, and
the dominions of death and the grave; and have opened, through
all the desert, a new and living way to my Father&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; The powers of darkness thought to strip me of my
official regalia, and bind me for ever in the grave; but I have
broken C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s seal, and rent the rocks of
Joseph&rsquo;s sepulchre, and am alive for evermore&mdash;the
high-priest, prophet, and king of Israel.&nbsp; Though I gave
myself up to death upon the cross, death could not deprive me of
my threefold office.&nbsp; I died with my vesture on, my miter
and breastplate, as high-priest over the house of God.&nbsp; I
died with the book of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven in
my hand, as a prophet to instruct my people, and lead them into
all truth.&nbsp; I died with the crown upon my head, and all my
enemies beneath my feet, as a king, whose dominion is
everlasting, and whose glory shall never end.&nbsp; Death and
hell could not take from me my triple diadem; and I came forth
from the place of the dead in the power of an endless life; and
will continue to wear my robes unspotted, till I have finished my
mediatorial work, and gathered all the saints unto
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; This stone is fitted and prepared by God
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will engrave the graving thereof, saith
the Lord of hosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This figure evidently refers to the sufferings of Christ, by
which he was made perfect for his mediatorial work.&nbsp; Many
hammers and chisels were upon him from Bethlehem to Calvary; but
they were all appointed of God, as the instruments of his
preparation to be the sure foundation and chief corner-stone of
the church.&nbsp; The Scribes and the Pharisees, Caiaphas, Judas,
Pilate, the Jewish populace, and the Roman soldiery, whatever
their malicious designs, only accomplished &ldquo;the determinate
counsel and foreknowledge of God&rdquo; upon his well-beloved
Son.&nbsp; All was appointed by the Father; all was understood by
the Messiah; all was necessary to secure the great objects of his
advent.&nbsp; It pleased the Father to bruise him, and put him to
grief; and he cheerfully submitted to suffer, that we might be
spared.&nbsp; O, wonder of wonders!&nbsp; Emmanuel wounded, that
sinners might be healed! the Golden Vessel marred, that the
earthen vessels might be saved! the Green Tree dried up, that the
dry tree might grow as the lily, and cast forth its roots like
Lebanon!&nbsp; According to another metaphor, &ldquo;the plowers
plowed upon his back; they made long their furrows.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And they were deep as well as <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>long.&nbsp; They plowed into his
very heart, and his body was covered with blood, and his cry of
agony pierced the supernatural gloom of Golgotha, and soured the
wine of dragons throughout the region of Gehenna!</p>
<p>Thus the foundation was fitted and prepared; and wicked men
and devils but blindly did the work which God had before
determined to be done.&nbsp; It is fixed in its place, firm and
immovable; and the chief Architect is raising other stones from
the quarry, and building them thereon, &ldquo;for a habitation of
God through the Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brethren, &ldquo;look unto
the rock whence ye are hewn, and the hole of the pit whence ye
are digged&rdquo;&mdash;even the flinty rock of impenitence, and
the horrible pit of corruption.&nbsp; I have known men relinquish
the hewing of stones from the quarry, because it was more expense
than profit; and I have known men abandon the digging of ore from
the mine, because it was too deep in the mountain.&nbsp; But
Christ &ldquo;descended into the lower parts of the earth,&rdquo;
and imbibed the gas of death.&nbsp; He carried in his hand the
hammer of the word, which breaketh the flinty rock in
pieces.&nbsp; He expelled the deadly vapor, blasted the solid
adamant, and prepared the way for the workmen; and when he
ascended, he sent down the apostles, to gather stones for his
spiritual temple; while he stands at the top of the shaft, and
turns the windlass of intercession, by which he draws up all to
himself.</p>
<p>The work was gloriously begun on the day of Pentecost, and men
and demons have never yet been able entirely to stop its
progress.&nbsp; The pope and the devil tried their best, for a
long time, to keep the digging and hewing tools of the twelve
wise master-builders concealed in the vaults of the monasteries;
but Luther, with the lamp of God in his hand, discovered them,
brought them forth, and set them at work; and millions of lively
stones have since been dug out, and sent up from the pit, to be
placed in the walls of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And still the gospel is mighty in the salvation of souls, of
which we have abundant evidence in the principality.&nbsp; What
multitudes were converted at Langeiththo in the days of Rowlands
and Williams; when two thousand communicants in the winter, and
three thousand in the summer, met every month in the same place
around the table of the Lord!&nbsp; And there are now in Wales
hundreds of large and flourishing churches among the Baptists and
Independents.&nbsp; <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>Glory to God, that I have in my own
possession the register of hundreds, who have been hewn from the
flinty rock, and raised from the horrible pit, to a place in the
Lord&rsquo;s holy temple&mdash;from drunkenness to sobriety, from
unbelief to faith in Christ, from enmity to reconciliation to
God, from persecution to patient suffering for
righteousness&rsquo; sake, from disobedience to the filial temper
of &ldquo;sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty;&rdquo; and
many of them I have seen going home, rejoicing, to their
Father&rsquo;s house above!</p>
<p>Hark! what do I hear?&nbsp; The hammers and chisels of mercy
all over the mountain of the militant church.&nbsp; The great
Architect is building up Zion.&nbsp; He is gathering his
materials from Europe, and Asia, and Africa, and America.&nbsp;
Glory to God!&nbsp; I hear his footsteps to-day in this mountain;
I see his hand in this congregation.&nbsp; Brethren in the
ministry, we are workers together with him.&nbsp; Delightful
work!&nbsp; How easy it is to preach, when the hand of God is
with us!&nbsp; Let us labour on!&nbsp; The topstone will soon be
brought forth with shouting, the sound of the building shall
cease, and we shall receive our reward!</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; The gracious design for which this Divine Foundation
is prepared, is the justification and sanctification of
sinners.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will remove the iniquity of that land in
one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ came to destroy the works of the devil&mdash;to take
away sin by the offering of himself.&nbsp; As the moon is
illuminated by the sun, so the rites and ceremonies of the old
testament are illustrated by the facts and doctrines of the
new.&nbsp; The priesthood of Jesus explains the priesthood of
Aaron.&nbsp; The one sacrifice of Calvary explains all the
sacrifices that went before.&nbsp; The glory of God in the face
of Jesus Christ enters the windows of Solomon&rsquo;s temple, and
penetrates the Holy of Holies within the vail.&nbsp; All the
bloody offerings of the Mosaic ritual were intended only as types
of him who &ldquo;removed the iniquity of that land in one
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What land?&nbsp; Emmanuel&rsquo;s land&mdash;a garden
enclosed, and measured by the line of God&rsquo;s eternal
purpose; including all the redeemed of the Lord, who will
ultimately be brought to glory.&nbsp; The map of &ldquo;that
land&rdquo; was in the mind of Jehovah, when he made this promise
through the prophet.&nbsp; He remembered his covenant engagement
before the foundation of the world in reference to its
redemption.&nbsp; He saw it encumbered by mountains of sin, and
blasted by the fiery curse of the law; and in the fulness of
time, he sent his Son to deliver it.</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>To
remove iniquity is to remove its penalty and its pollution.&nbsp;
Christ hath accomplished both for believers.&nbsp; He &ldquo;bore
our sins in his own body on the tree!&rdquo;&nbsp; He carried
upon his own shoulder the burden which must have sunk the whole
human race to eternal perdition.&nbsp; By enduring our
punishment, he provided for our purification.&nbsp; In his own
wounds a fountain was opened wherein we may wash and be
clean.&nbsp; From his own heart the balm was extracted whereby
our moral leprosy may be cured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of
God, that taketh away the sin of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; See how
our great High-priest removes the iniquity of his people; not,
like Aaron, by many sacrifices; but by the single offering of
himself, &ldquo;in one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word which is here rendered &ldquo;remove&rdquo; is in the
original the same as that which is used to express the
translation of Enoch.&nbsp; As Enoch was removed from the earth,
beyond the sight of man, and the power of death; so sin is
removed by the Mediator&mdash;removed for ever from the
believer&rsquo;s heart and conscience&mdash;blotted
out&mdash;cast into the depth of the sea&mdash;carried away into
the land of forgetfulness.&nbsp; The removal is perfect and
everlasting.</p>
<p>This was a work which Jewish sacrifices were too weak to
accomplish.&nbsp; For two thousand years the victims bled upon
the altar, and not a single sin was actually removed.&nbsp; Every
year the goat of the burnt-offering must bleed afresh, and the
scape-goat must be sent away into the wilderness.&nbsp; But
Jesus, the great ante-type of all these emblems, removed in one
day, by a single offering, the iniquities of all who believe in
him, from the fall to the end of time.</p>
<p>All the sacrifices that preceded his coming were intended only
to remind men that they were sinners, that they needed an
atonement, and that justification and eternal life could flow
only from the meritorious sufferings of the future Christ.&nbsp;
But when the substance came, the shadows passed away, and the
promised work was at once accomplished; and all our iniquities
were lost in the sea of mercy, which rose to a full tide in the
Mediator&rsquo;s merit.</p>
<p>Sinners, do you expect ever to be made free from sin?&nbsp;
Would you have your leprosy cured, your impurity cleansed, and
the curse removed?&nbsp; Come to our great High-priest!&nbsp; Lo,
he stands by the altar, and the blood is on his hands!&nbsp; He
waits to be gracious!&nbsp; Come, for he has virtually removed
your iniquity, and it requires in you but a simple act of faith
to realize the benefit!&nbsp; &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus
Christ, and thou shalt be saved!&rdquo;</p>

JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>But how should man be just with
God</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;Job ix. 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Almighty proclaimed himself to
Moses, &ldquo;the Lord, merciful and gracious;&rdquo; and in the
New Testament, he is called &ldquo;the God of all
grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where sin abounded, grace did much
more abound; that as sin reigned unto death, even so might grace
reign, through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ
our Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; God is determined to glorify the
unsearchable riches of his grace in the salvation of
sinners.&nbsp; But how can this be done, without casting a cloud
over the Divine throne, and bringing into contempt the Divine
law?&nbsp; How can the guilty be considered and treated as
innocent, without an apparent indifference to the evil of sin,
and a total disregard of the claims of eternal justice?&nbsp; How
can the rebel be acquitted in the court of Heaven, with honor to
the character of God, and safety to the interests of his moral
government?&nbsp; This is a question which angels could not
answer; but it has been answered by the God of angels.&nbsp; The
light of nature and reason is too feeble to afford us any aid in
this inquiry; &ldquo;but we have a more sure word of prophecy,
whereunto we do well that we take heed, as unto a light that
shineth in a dark place;&rdquo; for &ldquo;God hath shined in our
hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,
in the face of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following, then, the guidance of the New Testament, let us
consider the nature and the ground of a sinner&rsquo;s
justification with God.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; To justify is the public act of a judge, declaring a
person innocent, not liable to punishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is God
that justifieth&rdquo; the <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>ungodly.&nbsp; Justification, in its
strict sense, and remission of sins, are two very different
things.&nbsp; Job could forgive his friends; but he could not
justify them.&nbsp; But in the gracious economy of the gospel,
these are always immediately connected; nor these alone, but
other and superior mercies&mdash;mercies infinite and
unspeakable.&nbsp; Those whom God justifieth are not only
forgiven, but also purified and renewed&mdash;not only delivered
from condemnation, but also entitled to eternal life&mdash;not
only redeemed from the curse of the law, but also blessed with
the spirit and the privilege of adoption&mdash;not only liberated
from bondage and imprisonment, but also constituted heirs
&ldquo;to an inheritance that fadeth not away.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
are &ldquo;heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are kings and priests, and shall reign
for ever and ever.&nbsp; God having given his Son as our surety,
and published &ldquo;the law of the spirit of life in Christ
Jesus,&rdquo; and taken his seat upon the throne of grace in the
character of a merciful judge, he proclaims the believer free
from condemnation, and &ldquo;accepted in the Beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a human court, a man may be either justified or
forgiven.&nbsp; Sometimes the jury find the prisoner innocent,
and he is acquitted; sometimes they find him guilty, and he is
forgiven.&nbsp; The former is an act of justice; the latter, an
act of mercy.&nbsp; No earthly court can go farther; no earthly
court can justify the guilty.&nbsp; But God is able, through the
wonderful economy of substitution and atonement revealed in the
gospel, in the same court, from the same throne, by the same law,
and in the same sentence, to proclaim full pardon and free
justification to the sinner.&nbsp; By virtue of the obedience and
suffering of Christ on his behalf, he is at once forgiven and
justified.&nbsp; Faith unites us to Christ, and gives us an
interest in him, as our Mediator, who &ldquo;bore our sins in his
own body on the tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Even as David also
describeth the blessedness of the man to whom God imputeth
righteousness without works:&mdash;Blessed are they whose
iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is
the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The righteousness by which the sinner is justified infinitely
transcends all other righteousness in earth or heaven.&nbsp; It
is the righteousness of the Second Adam&mdash;an invaluable
pearl, to which all the members of Christ&rsquo;s mystical body
are equally entitled.&nbsp; It is the pure gold of the gospel,
which cannot be mixed with the works of the law, or derive any
increase of value from human merit.&nbsp; It <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>lies upon
the very surface of evangelical truth, like oil upon the
water.&nbsp; It is the righteousness finished upon the
cross&mdash;a complete wedding garment furnished by the Son of
God, which the sinner has only to put on to be prepared for the
marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>
<p>How cold and cheerless is the doctrine of the mere moralist,
leaving the poor sinner wallowing in the mire, and weltering in
his blood, with nothing but his own works to depend upon for
salvation!&nbsp; But the doctrine of justification through the
satisfying righteousness of Jesus Christ warms the heart, and
quickens the soul of the believer into a new and heavenly
life.&nbsp; Here is our deliverance from the curse of the
law.&nbsp; Here the relation between us and Adam is annihilated,
and another relation is established between us and Christ.&nbsp;
Here is the sea into which our sins are cast to rise no
more.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is, therefore, now no condemnation to
them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but
after the spirit;&rdquo; and they may boldly say&mdash;&ldquo;O
Lord, I will praise thee; for though thou wast angry with me,
thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The ground of our justification now claims a more
particular attention.</p>
<p>This is a subject of the greatest importance; for if we build
upon the sand, the whole superstructure inevitably falls, and
great must be the fall thereof.&nbsp; The Jews, being ignorant of
God&rsquo;s righteousness&mdash;the righteousness of
faith&mdash;went about to establish their own, which was by the
works of the law.&nbsp; Let us examine these two
foundations&mdash;the righteousness which is of the law, and that
which is of faith.</p>
<p>What sort of righteousness does the law demand, as the ground
of our acceptance with God?&nbsp; It must originate in the
heart.&nbsp; It must be commensurate with life, and not a broken
link in the chain, for he that offendeth in one point is guilty
of all.&nbsp; It must be so comprehensive as to include all your
duties to God, your neighbor and yourself.&nbsp; It must engage
all the powers of your mind, without the least imperfection, in
thought, word, or deed.&nbsp; The coin must be pure gold, of full
weight and measure, and bearing the right and lawful stamp.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
written in the book of the law to do them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what saith the righteousness which is of
faith?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Believe In the Lord Jesus Christ, and
thou shalt be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>believeth
shall never be confounded.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Christ is the end
of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He hath magnified the law, and
made it honorable.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He hath redeemed us from
the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is the doctrine which answers all our questions, removes all
our guilty fears, and opens to us a path of hope in the valley of
the shadow of death.&nbsp; The justifying righteousness of Christ
is as deep as the misery of man, as high as the requirements of
God, as broad as the commandment, and as long as eternity.&nbsp;
It is sufficient for all them that believe, and able to save unto
the uttermost.&nbsp; It is a deluge which covers the mountains of
transgression, and bears the believer securely in the ark.&nbsp;
It comes to the sinner, shut up under the judgment of God, and
reads to him the article of his manumission.&nbsp; I hear it
addressing the guilty in the following language:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the Son of God coming forth from the bosom of the
Father, and uniting himself to the nature of man.&nbsp; I saw the
mighty God manifested in the Son of Mary, and lying in a
manger.&nbsp; I beheld some of his blood shed, as an earnest to
the law, when he was eight days old.&nbsp; I stood in the garden
of Gethsemane, when he drank the cup of trembling mingled and
presented by his Father&rsquo;s justice.&nbsp; I was with him on
Calvary, when he blotted out the handwriting of Eden and Sinai,
and nailed it to his cross&mdash;when he finished the redemption
of man, and spoiled the powers of darkness, and sealed with his
own blood the covenant of peace, I beheld him descending to the
lower parts of the earth, and lying under the sinner&rsquo;s
sentence in the grave.&nbsp; I beheld him rising in the same
human nature, with the keys of death and hell in his hand, and
the crown of the mediatorial kingdom upon his head.&nbsp; I
beheld him ascending to the right-hand of the Father, leading thy
captivity captive, and entering into heaven itself, there to
appear in the presence of God for thee.&nbsp; And now I see him
in the midst of the throne, as a lamb newly slain; and the merit
of his sacrifice, as a sweet-smelling savor, fills the heaven of
heavens.&nbsp; On thy behalf he has honored the law, satisfied
the claims of justice, and opened a new and living way, whereby
God can be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in
Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the question is answered&mdash;&ldquo;How should man be
just with God?&rdquo;&nbsp; Sinners are &ldquo;justified freely
by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore we conclude <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>that a man
is justified by faith, without the deeds of the law.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is the key-stone of the gospel, and the strength of the arch
of salvation.&nbsp; The only way to obtain acceptance with God is
by grace; &ldquo;and if by grace, then it is no more of
works.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the justification of the sinner, Divine
grace and human works can no more be mixed together than oil and
water, for they belong to different covenants.&nbsp; Christ came
into the world, not to repair the old covenant, but to be the
mediator of a new covenant, established upon better
promises&mdash;not to mend the leaky and sinking vessel of the
law, but to build and launch a new ark of salvation, and rescue
the shipwrecked and the drowning.&nbsp; The law could not
save.&nbsp; The law is holy, but we are unclean.&nbsp; The law is
spiritual, but we are carnal.&nbsp; The law is righteous, but we
are guilty.&nbsp; The law is good, but every imagination of the
thoughts of the heart of man is evil, and only evil, and that
continually.&nbsp; The law will not consent to a compromise with
the sinner, will not relax its claims upon him, nor in any way
accommodate itself to his fallen condition.&nbsp; Its power to
condemn is commensurate with its authority to command.</p>
<p>Thus we see how it is that no man can be justified by the
deeds of the law.&nbsp; We are not under the law, but under
grace.&nbsp; Were we under the law, the deeds of the law would be
sufficient for our justification.&nbsp; The law demands
obedience; obedience satisfies the law.&nbsp; Between obedience
and the law there is perfect correspondence and harmony; the one
gives what the other asks.&nbsp; There is also a perfect
agreement between grace and faith.&nbsp; Grace bestows freely,
without money and without price; and faith, having nothing to
pay, receives humbly and thankfully.&nbsp; Grace, by bestowing,
acquires great glory; faith, by receiving, obtains great
happiness.&nbsp; God confers blessings according to the riches of
his grace; sinners receive according to the strength of their
faith.&nbsp; Faith and the law cannot agree at all, for both are
seeking and receiving; neither can works and grace agree, for
both live by communicating.&nbsp; Therefore &ldquo;by grace are
ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the
gift of God; not of works, lest any man should
boast.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ye are justified through the righteousness
and merit of Christ, who became your substitute, and both obeyed
the law and suffered the penalty in your stead.</p>
<p>This view of the ground of a sinner&rsquo;s justification is
everywhere <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>sustained in the Holy Scriptures.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the
obedience of one, shall many be made righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;By the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all
men, unto justification of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
obedience of one,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the righteousness of
one,&rdquo; in these two sentences, signify the same thing.&nbsp;
Again: &ldquo;He who knew no sin was made sin for us, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;In whom we have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his
grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All we like sheep have gone astray,
and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&nbsp; He
was wounded for our transgressions; he was bruised for our
iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with
his stripes we are healed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The perfect obedience of Christ, and his meritorious death,
were both necessary, as the ground of a sinner&rsquo;s
justification.&nbsp; Neither would have been sufficient without
the other.&nbsp; His obedience would not answer without his
death; for the law which had been broken must be honored; and the
penalty which had been incurred by the sinner must be endured by
the Substitute.&nbsp; Neither would his death answer without his
obedience; for it is the obedient, and not the punished, that the
law justifies; he who keeps the precept, and not he who endures
the penalty.&nbsp; It is only by satisfying both claims on our
behalf, that Christ &ldquo;of God is made unto us wisdom, and
righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it is said we are justified by faith, it is not meant
that there is any merit in faith, any justifying efficacy; but
that faith is the condition on which we are justified for the
sake of him who obeyed and suffered for us&mdash;the Divinely
appointed means by which we appropriate the merit of his
obedience and suffering.&nbsp; It is by the eye of faith we see
the excellency and adaptation of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness and
merit; and it is by the hand of faith we take and put on the
wedding garment provided for us, and thus prepare ourselves for
the marriage supper of the Lamb.&nbsp; Faith is the bond which
unites us to Christ, by virtue of which union we are
justified.&nbsp; Faith is the wedding ring by which the poor
daughter of the old Amorite is married to the Prince of
Peace.&nbsp; She is raised from the greatest poverty and
degradation to unspeakable opulence and honor, not because of the
intrinsic value of the ring, though it is a golden one; but on
account of the union which it signifies between her and her
Beloved.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that hath the Son hath life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>&ldquo;But faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being
alone.&nbsp; Yea, a man may say&mdash;Thou hast faith, and I have
works.&nbsp; Show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show
thee my faith by my works.&nbsp; Thou believest that there is one
God; thou doest well; the devils also believe, and tremble.&nbsp;
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is
dead?&nbsp; Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when
he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?&nbsp; Seest thou how
faith wrought with his works?&nbsp; And by works was faith made
perfect; and the scripture was fulfilled which
saith&mdash;Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for
righteousness, and he was called the friend of God.&nbsp; Ye see,
then, how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith
only.&nbsp; Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by
works, when she had received the messengers, and sent them out
another way?&nbsp; For as the body without the spirit is dead, so
faith without works is dead also.&rdquo; <a
name="citation256"></a><a href="#footnote256"
class="citation">[256]</a></p>
<p>We have noticed the nature and ground of justification; in
these words of the Apostle, we have the evidence of
justification.&nbsp; The same doctrine was preached by our
Saviour:&mdash;&ldquo;For by thy works thou shalt be justified,
and by thy works thou shalt be condemned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Works
justify only as the fruit of faith.&nbsp; A faith that does not
produce good works is inefficient and worthless.&nbsp; It is not
the faith which justifies the ungodly.&nbsp; What is it that
justifies a man in a court of law?&nbsp; The goodness of his
cause?&nbsp; No, verily.&nbsp; A man of common sense will not
think of making a long speech to the jury, without adducing any
evidence of the truth of his statements.&nbsp; My fellow sinners,
if your cause is good, why do you not prove it?&nbsp; Why not
bring forward your evidence?&nbsp; Why not act in this supremely
important case as in every other?&nbsp; If you have justifying
faith, let us see the fruit in a sanctified life.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father which is in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this world, every man receives according to his faith; in
the world to come, every man shall receive according to his
works.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord, for
they rest from their labors, and their works do follow
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their works do not go before them to divide
the river Jordan, and open the gates <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>of heaven.&nbsp; This is done by
their faith.&nbsp; But their works are left behind, as if done up
in a packet, on this side of the river.&nbsp; John saw the great
white throne descending for judgment, the Son of Man sitting
thereon, and all nations gathered before him.&nbsp; He is
dividing the righteous from the wicked, as the shepherd divideth
the sheep from the goats.&nbsp; The wicked are set on the
left-hand, and the awful sentence is
pronounced&mdash;&ldquo;Depart from me, ye accursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the righteous are placed on the
right-hand, to hear the joyful welcome&mdash;&ldquo;Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; The books are opened,
and Mercy presents the packets that were left on the other side
of Jordan.&nbsp; They are all opened, and the books are read
wherein all their acts of benevolence and virtue are
recorded.&nbsp; Justice examines the several packets, and
answers&mdash;&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; Here they are.&nbsp; Thus
it is written&mdash;&lsquo;I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I
was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took
me in; I was naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited
me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The
righteous look upon each other with wonder, and
answer&mdash;&ldquo;Those packets must belong to others.&nbsp; We
knew nothing of all that.&nbsp; We recollect the wormwood and the
gall.&nbsp; We recollect the strait gate, the narrow way, and the
Slough of Despond.&nbsp; We recollect the heavy burden that
pressed so hard upon us, and how it fell from our shoulders at
the sight of the cross.&nbsp; We recollect the time when the eyes
of our minds were opened, to behold the evil of sin, the
depravity of our hearts, and the excellency of our
Redeemer.&nbsp; We recollect the time when our stubborn wills
were subdued in the day of his power, so that we were enabled
both to will and to do of his good pleasure.&nbsp; We recollect
the time when we obtained hope in the merit of Christ, and felt
the efficacy of his blood applied to our hearts by the Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; And we shall never forget the time when we first
experienced the love of God shed abroad in our hearts.&nbsp; O,
how sweetly and powerfully it constrained us to love him, his
cause, and his ordinances!&nbsp; How we panted after communion
and fellowship with him, as the hart panteth after the
water-brooks!&nbsp; All this, and a thousand other things, are as
fresh in our memory as ever.&nbsp; But we recollect nothing of
those bundles of good works.&nbsp; Where was it? <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>Lord, when
saw we thee hungry, and fed thee; or thirsty, and gave thee
drink; or a stranger, and took thee in; or naked, and clothed
thee?&nbsp; We have no more recollection than the dead, of ever
having visited thee in prison, or ministered to thee in
sickness.&nbsp; Surely, those bundles cannot belong to
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mercy replies&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, verily, they
belong to you; for your names are upon them; and besides, they
have not been out of my hands since you left them on the stormy
banks of Jordan.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the King
answers&mdash;&ldquo;Verily, I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done
it unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the righteous do not know their own good works; if they do
not recognise, in the sheaves which they reap at the
resurrection, the seed which they have sown in tears on earth,
they certainly cannot make these things the foundation of their
hopes of heaven.&nbsp; Christ crucified is their sole dependence
for acceptance with God, in time and in eternity.&nbsp; Christ
crucified is the great object of their faith, and the centre of
their affections; and while their love to him prompts them to
live soberly, and righteously, and godly, in this present evil
world, they cordially exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;Not unto us, not into
us, but to thy name, O Lord, give glory!&rdquo;&nbsp; Amen.</p>

THE SHIELD OF FAITH.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Above all</i>, <i>taking the shield of
faith</i>, <i>wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery
darts of the wicked</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Eph. vi. 16.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Christian is engaged in a
warfare, &ldquo;not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
this world, against spiritual wickedness&rdquo;&mdash;or wicked
spirits&mdash;&ldquo;in high places;&rdquo; who go about like
roaring lions, seeking whom they may devour; assailing the
servants of Christ even on their high places&mdash;their Pizgahs,
their Tabors, their Olivets; swarming up from the sea of
corruption within and around us, like the frogs in Egypt, and
entering into our very bed-chambers and closets of devotion.</p>
<p>These spiritual adversaries must be opposed with spiritual
armor; and the apostle has here given us a complete set of
weapons for fighting, and a complete panoply for defence.&nbsp;
The Roman armor consisted of several parts, all of which St. Paul
makes use of figuratively, to represent the several Christian
graces by which we resist our subtle, deceitful, and invisible
enemies.&nbsp; As the articles to which he alludes constituted a
complete coat of arms, and the soldier was not prepared for the
field without the whole; so the Christian graces which they
represent are all of them important, &ldquo;that the man of God
may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of these heavenly qualities may appear
brighter at particular times in one Christian than in another;
but the whole list is indispensable to every spiritual
warrior.&nbsp; Abraham may excel in faith, Moses in meekness, Job
in patience, Daniel in <a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>courage, Peter in zeal, Paul in
humility, and John in love; but each must have the entire armor,
though different occasions may require the use of different
articles in the catalogue.&nbsp; That you may be able to stand in
the evil day, you must have the shoes of peace, to preserve your
feet; the girdle of truth, to strengthen your loins; the helmet
of hope, to defend your heads; the breastplate of righteousness,
to cover your hearts; the sword of the Spirit, to cut your way
through the columns of the foe; &ldquo;And above all, taking the
shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is only to this article last mentioned, that we would now
call your attention; in the consideration of which, let us
notice, <i>first</i>, The nature of faith; and <i>secondly</i>,
Its importance and utility as a shield.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; There are many passages in the word of God which show
the excellency of faith; but there is only one passage which
contains an exact definition of faith; and that you will find in
the first verse of the eleventh chapter of Paul&rsquo;s epistle
to the Hebrews:&mdash;&ldquo;Now faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&rdquo;&mdash;or, as it
may be read&mdash;the confidence of things hoped for, the
conviction of things not seen.&nbsp; I am surprised that divines
have taken so little notice of this passage, in treating of the
nature of faith.&nbsp; Generally, they wander in the wilderness
without a guide; they put out to sea without compass, chart, or
helm.&nbsp; Some of them make faith every thing, and others make
it almost nothing.&nbsp; According to the apostle&rsquo;s
definition, it consists of these two things:&mdash;a conviction
of the truth of the gospel testimony relative to things
invisible, and a confidence in the character and word of the
invisible Testifier.&nbsp; This is a common-sense
definition.&nbsp; Here is no mystification or obscurity.&nbsp; In
this way the term faith is understood by all men.&nbsp; In the
ordinary transactions of business, we seldom mistake each other
on this subject; why should we in the great concern of salvation
pending between us and God?</p>
<p>Here is a man who has a note for an amount sufficient to
support him comfortably, were he to live a thousand years.&nbsp;
Still he appears very unhappy&mdash;full of doubts and fears
about his future subsistence.&nbsp; Ask him&mdash;&ldquo;Friend,
what think you of that note? is it genuine?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O
yes,&rdquo; he replies, &ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied that it
is genuine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the reason, then, that
you are not more cheerful and <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>happy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas, I
have no confidence in the bank.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man is without
faith.&nbsp; True, he believes&mdash;he believes that the note is
not a counterfeit&mdash;he is well satisfied of its genuineness;
but such a belief is not sufficient, while he is suspicious of
the bank&mdash;produces no change in his feelings or his
conduct.&nbsp; But if, in addition to his conviction of the
genuineness of the note, he could be satisfied of the goodness of
the bank, then you should find him quite another man.&nbsp; These
two things united constitute faith:&mdash;Believing the truth of
the gospel respecting things unseen; and trusting in the power
and faithfulness of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, to fulfil
his promises.&nbsp; This is the faith that justifieth the
ungodly; this is the faith that overcometh the world.</p>
<p>Now every one of you believes the truth of the gospel; but the
promises of the gospel, which are worthy of all acceptation, some
of you have not accepted&mdash;are no more influenced by them
than if they did not belong to you.&nbsp; The gospel contains a
pearl of great price&mdash;&ldquo;an inheritance incorruptible,
undefiled, and that fadeth not away;&rdquo; but your confidence
in the promise is feeble and inefficient&mdash;does not lead you
to prayer&mdash;does not influence your conduct, so as to bring
you in possession of this heavenly treasure.&nbsp; You have no
faith.&nbsp; You have one of the elements of faith, but not the
other.&nbsp; You have the belief, but not the
confidence&mdash;that part of faith which belongs to the
intellect, but not that which belongs to the heart.&nbsp;
Therefore you are still poor, and naked, and miserable.</p>
<p>The Holy Scriptures record many admirable instances of true
faith; in which confidence in the character, the providence, and
the promises of God, rises into the most perfect assurance.&nbsp;
Behold those women on the bank of the Nile.&nbsp; They are making
a basket of bulrushes, and plastering it with bitumen.&nbsp;
Placing the infant Moses therein, they commit the frail ark to
the floods.&nbsp; Jochebed, why dost thou not fear that the child
will be drowned?&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe the promises of God, I
believe that he will do good unto his people.&nbsp; I trust in
him for the salvation of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>See that old man on mount Moriah.&nbsp; He has built a rude
altar, and laid fire and wood thereon.&nbsp; He has bound his own
son&mdash;his only son&mdash;his well-beloved Isaac, and is about
to offer him as a sacrifice.&nbsp; Abraham, stay thy hand.&nbsp;
Wilt thou slay thy only son?&nbsp; Then what will become of the
promise?&nbsp; &ldquo;My mind is easy.&nbsp; I <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>will obey
God.&nbsp; I believe he is able to raise Isaac from the
dead.&nbsp; I feel assured that he will return home with me
alive, and that from him will spring the Messiah.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
Abraham determined to offer Isaac upon the altar, for he confided
in the promise&mdash;&ldquo;In Isaac shall thy seed be
called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have another instance in the Centurion whose servant was
healed by our Lord.&nbsp; He had perfect confidence in the word
of Christ, even though Christ had given him no promise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only say in a word,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and my servant
shall be healed.&nbsp; Thy word created the world; thy word has
quickened the dead; and thy word can accomplish a cure without a
journey to my house.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is an instance of
remarkable faith; and our Lord testified&mdash;&ldquo;I have not
found so great faith, no, not in Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever the object of faith, it is always the same in its
nature, though not always the same in degree.&nbsp; Christ said
to his disciples&mdash;&ldquo;O ye of little faith!&rdquo; and
the apostle saith of Abraham&mdash;&ldquo;He was strong in faith,
giving glory to God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Faith is represented in the
Scriptures by a variety of expressions, such as&mdash;believing
the testimony of God&mdash;relying or staying upon the
Lord&mdash;waiting upon him&mdash;trusting in him&mdash;looking
unto him&mdash;coming to Christ&mdash;putting on the Lord
Jesus&mdash;committing the keeping of the soul to him, as unto a
faithful Creator.&nbsp; These different expressions denote the
several modifications of faith, and its several degrees of
intensity; but they all fall under the apostolical definition
noticed above.</p>
<p>The language of the law was&mdash;&ldquo;Do this and
live.&rdquo;&nbsp; The language of the gospel
is&mdash;&ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
he saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; Faith in Christ is the prescribed and only
condition of acceptance with God.&nbsp; Christ is the way, and
the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by
him.&nbsp; Faith is the eye with which we behold his mercy; faith
is the hand by which we receive his blessings; faith is the
golden chain which binds us to him for ever.&nbsp; The necessity
of faith in the merit and righteousness of our Divine Mediator,
as the condition of salvation, is a truth which lies scattered
over the surface of inspired Scripture.&nbsp; God has always
owned and blessed its proclamation in the conversion of
souls.&nbsp; It was the article of Luther&rsquo;s emancipation
from legal bondage.&nbsp; It was the master-key which unlocked
the iron gates of Antichrist, and poured the true light over all
Europe; so that neither pope nor council, nor both together,
could <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>hide it again under a bushel.&nbsp; And in the church
of England, even in its present weak and languid state, whenever
one of its ministers preaches clearly and faithfully this blessed
doctrine, souls are given him as the seals of his ministry.</p>
<p>There is no end to the praises of faith.&nbsp; Faith is the
glass that draws fire from the Sun of Righteousness.&nbsp; Faith
is the wedding ring that joins the sinner to Christ in an
everlasting covenant.&nbsp; Faith is the living principle of all
holy obedience, working by love, and purifying the heart.&nbsp;
If God command a man to leave his country and his kindred, and go
into a strange land&mdash;to offer his beloved son as a sacrifice
upon the altar&mdash;to build an ark on dry ground&mdash;to go to
the fiery furnace, or the lions&rsquo; den&mdash;to face his
exasperated foes at Jerusalem, or hide from them in the caves of
the mountains&mdash;it is faith that prompts him to the painful
duty, and sustains him therein, in spite of improbabilities; and
amidst difficulties, dangers, and deaths.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; This brings us to notice the importance and utility
of faith as a shield.&nbsp; &ldquo;And above all, taking the
shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith is in some respects the first of all the Christian
graces.&nbsp; It is the beginning of spiritual life in the
soul&mdash;the originating and sustaining principle of all
evangelical holiness.&nbsp; Having faith, we have nothing to do
but to add to it all the rest of our lives.&nbsp; &ldquo;Add to
your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge
temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience
godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
kindness charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Love is in some respects superior to faith, and shall live and
rejoice before the throne when faith shall have finished its
work; but faith is an impenetrable shield, such as love cannot
furnish, on the field of battle.&nbsp; The shield was a broad
piece of defensive armor, worn ordinarily on the left arm; and
which, being movable, might be used to defend any part of the
body.&nbsp; According to Homer, the shields of some of the
warriors at the siege of Troy were made of sevenfold thick
bull-hides, covered with brass.</p>
<p>The value of &ldquo;the shield of faith&rdquo; is seen in the
case of David.&nbsp; Look down there in the valley.&nbsp; There
is Goliath of Gath, the chief of the giants, blaspheming, and
defying the armies of the living God.&nbsp; His spear is as a
weaver&rsquo;s beam, and his armor-bearer <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>carries
before him an enormous shield.&nbsp; And there is a fine-looking
young man going down to meet him, without any visible weapons,
except his shepherd&rsquo;s sling, and five smooth stones from
the brook.&nbsp; David! hast thou no fear?&nbsp; Rash youth! is
thy unpractised hand able to cope with the mailed champion of
Philistia?&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go and meet him in the name of my
God, for I know that the Lord will deliver him into my
hand.&nbsp; God will avenge his people, and vindicate his own
honor against the insults of his enemies.&nbsp; He who defended
me against the lion and the bear will save me from the hand of
the blasphemer, and glorify himself this day before the thousands
of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He moves on, invincibly shielded by his
faith, and the next moment Goliath is slain with his own
sword.</p>
<p>Let us look again at the case of Abraham.&nbsp; God said unto
him&mdash;&ldquo;Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom
thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him
there for a burnt offering, upon one of the mountains that I will
tell thee of.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the enemy assails him, in the
persuasive language of natural affection, and carnal reasoning;
and every word is like a flaming arrow in the patriarch&rsquo;s
heart:&mdash;&ldquo;Abraham! if thou obey this command, thou wilt
disobey thereby many other commands.&nbsp; God hath
said&mdash;&lsquo;Thou shalt not kill;&rsquo; and wilt thou shed
the blood of thy own child?&nbsp; Canst thou so trample upon the
law of God, and all the tender instincts of human nature?&nbsp;
How will thy servants regard thee&mdash;how will the world look
upon thee, after so horrible a deed?&nbsp; What will they think
of thy God, when they hear that he has required at thy hand the
immolation of thy only son?&nbsp; Will it not bring everlasting
dishonor upon his name?&nbsp; And what will become of the Divine
promise upon which thy faith is built&mdash;that from
Isaac&rsquo;s loins shall spring the Messiah, the hope of the
world?&nbsp; Besides, thou wilt certainly break poor old
Sarah&rsquo;s heart; she will never be able to survive the loss,
in so dreadful a manner, of her darling boy.&nbsp; If thou hast
any feelings of humanity in thy heart, any fear of God before
thine eyes, any regard for the glory of his name among men,
refrain from that deed of blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the &ldquo;fiery darts&rdquo; which &ldquo;the
wicked one&rdquo; hurled at the good man&rsquo;s heart, but they
fell harmless upon his &ldquo;shield of faith.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;He staggered not at the promise through
unbelief.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He conferred not with flesh and
blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; He rose up early in <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>the
morning, took Isaac and the servants, and set out for the
appointed place of sacrifice.&nbsp; He travelled three days
toward Moriah, with a settled purpose to cut Isaac&rsquo;s body
in pieces, and shed the blood of his heart upon the altar, and
burn it to ashes in the consuming flames.&nbsp; He loved his son
as his own soul, but the command of God was dearer to his
heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Abraham said unto his young
men&mdash;Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go
yonder, and worship, and come again to you;&rdquo; for he firmly
believed that God would raise his son from the ashes of the
altar, and that they would return together.&nbsp; I see them
ascending the hill&mdash;O, what an ascent was that!&nbsp; Never
was there a walk so sorrowful, till the great Antitype of Isaac
ascended the same mountain to &ldquo;make his soul a sacrifice
for sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The altar is built, the fire and the wood
are placed thereon; and O for words to describe the feelings of
both father and son, when Abraham laid hold on Isaac, and took
the knife to plunge it into his heart!&nbsp; There is a
pause.&nbsp; The patriarch&rsquo;s arm is stretched aloft, with
the instrument of death.&nbsp; God of mercy! is there no help for
a father?&nbsp; Earth cannot speak; but there comes a voice from
heaven; and O, with what melody it rings through Abraham&rsquo;s
heart!&mdash;&ldquo;Abraham!&nbsp; Abraham! lay not thine hand
upon the lad; for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou
hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the triumph of faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;By faith Abraham,
when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that had received the
promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was
said&mdash;In Isaac shall thy seed be called; accounting that God
was able to raise him up even from the dead, from whence also he
received him in a figure.&rdquo;&nbsp; The patriarch&rsquo;s
faith quenched &ldquo;all the fiery darts of the wicked
one,&rdquo; which were cast at him in this dreadful trial.</p>
<p>The arrows of the orientals were often poisoned at one end,
and ignited at the other.&nbsp; It is to this circumstance the
apostle alludes in the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;the fiery darts of the
wicked,&rdquo; or the wicked one.&nbsp; Satan has his quiver full
of impoisoned and flaming arrows, from which the servants of
Christ would be much endangered without &ldquo;the shield of
faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shot one of them at Eve in Paradise, and
set the whole world on fire, &ldquo;and it is set on fire of
hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shot an arrow of lust at David, and an
arrow of fear at Peter; and both of them were dreadfully wounded
in the back.&nbsp; He shot <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>an arrow of covetousness at Judas,
and another at Ananias and Sapphira; and having no &ldquo;shield
of faith,&rdquo; they were smitten, and dropped down into
hell.</p>
<p>The devil is a fierce and malicious enemy, &ldquo;going about
as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fain
would he destroy all the holy from the earth.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;fiery darts&rdquo; inflame the heart with the love of sin,
the fear of man, the torments of remorse, and the apprehensions
of judgment and fiery indignation.&nbsp; But when the heart is
shielded by the faith of the gospel&mdash;when we clearly
understand the truth as it is in Jesus, cordially assent to it,
appropriate it experimentally, and surrender ourselves to its
sanctifying influence&mdash;they have no power to injure, and the
Christian is more than conqueror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast not away, therefore, the beginning of your
confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Grasp firmly the shield.&nbsp; Whatever the aspect of the fight,
hold it fast till the end.&nbsp; You will need it through all the
campaign.&nbsp; You will need it especially in your contest with
&ldquo;the last enemy, which is death.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; So shall you be able to testify with Paul,
when he anticipated the termination of the warfare&mdash;&ldquo;I
have fought a good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept
the faith; and henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness, which the Lord&mdash;the righteous
judge&mdash;shall give unto me in that day.&rdquo;</p>

THE PARACLETE.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>And I will pray the Father</i>, <i>and
he shall give you another Comforter</i>, <i>that he may abide
with you for ever</i>; <i>even the Spirit of Truth</i>, <i>whom
the world cannot receive</i>, <i>because it seeth him not</i>,

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bible is a most wonderful
book.&nbsp; It came to us from heaven, and is stamped with the
Spirit and the character of heaven.&nbsp; It assails our favorite
maxims and customs, and declares that he who will be the friend
of this world is the enemy of God.&nbsp; It will consent to no
compromise with sin.&nbsp; It will not in the least accommodate
itself to the carnal inclinations of the human heart.&nbsp; What
is written is written, and not one jot or tittle can be altered
till heaven and earth shall pass away.&nbsp; It is the sword of
God, by which he conquers the nations&mdash;the instrument of his
grace, by which he renovates the world.&nbsp; Like the ark in the
land of the Philistines, which was mightier than all their lords,
and Dagon their god, it is more than a match for the cunning and
prowess of the Prince of Darkness and his hosts.&nbsp; He who
disobeys it kindles a volcano; he who obeys opens to himself a
fountain of living waters.&nbsp; And the secret of all its
wonderful qualities and achievements is found in its Divine
inspiration, and the power of the Holy Ghost which accompanies
its truths.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit,&rdquo;
and the Spirit that brought it into the world continues in the
world to wield it, and render it quick and powerful.</p>
<p>These remarks introduce to our consideration the mission and
office of the Holy Ghost, of which our Saviour speaks in the
language of the text.&nbsp; And,</p>
<p><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>I.&nbsp; We remark, that the Holy Ghost is evidently
not a Divine attribute merely, but a Divine person.</p>
<p>His personality is proved by the terms applied to him in the
text&mdash;the &ldquo;Comforter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Spirit of
Truth;&rdquo; and by many other passages where he is spoken of in
similar language&mdash;language wholly incompatible with the idea
of his being a mere attribute, and not a person.</p>
<p>The doctrine of his Divinity is sustained by so many texts
that their mere quotation would be an irrefutable argument in its
favor.&nbsp; David says&mdash;&ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord spake
by me, and his word was in my tongue; the God of Israel
said,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Here the Holy Ghost is called
&ldquo;the Spirit of the Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the God of
Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Ananias &ldquo;lied to the Holy
Ghost,&rdquo; it is said he &ldquo;lied to God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
ordinance of Baptism is ordered to be administered &ldquo;in the
name of the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;the name of the
Father and the Son;&rdquo; and his &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; is
equally invoked with the love of the former, and the grace of the
latter, in the apostolical benediction.&nbsp; Besides, every
attribute that belongs to the Deity belongs to him.&nbsp; He is
omnipresent, omniscient, and eternal.&nbsp; He is the Spirit of
truth, the Spirit of grace, and the Spirit of life.&nbsp; His
works also are the works of God.&nbsp; He creates and quickens,
which is the prerogative of God alone.&nbsp; He renovates the
soul.&nbsp; He raised the body of Jesus, and will raise the
bodies of all men in the last day.&nbsp; Finally: Blasphemy
against the Son may be forgiven; but &ldquo;blasphemy against the
Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, neither in this world nor in
that which is to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; If, then, the Father is God,
and if the Son is God, so also is the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost is the messenger and representative
of Jesus Christ in the Church.</p>
<p>Two promises, like heavenly merchant-vessels, brought
salvation to our world.&nbsp; The first was given in Eden, and
fulfilled on Calvary.&nbsp; The Son of God descended from heaven,
suffered in our stead the curse of the law, spoiled the powers of
death and hell, and returned to his Father, leaving another
promise, shortly to be fulfilled upon his people.&nbsp; With what
supernatural power and unction the Holy Spirit manifested himself
on the day of Pentecost!&nbsp; Divine Comforter! what treasure
bringest thou in thy vessel of grace?&nbsp; &ldquo;The things of
Christ; and I will unload them to-day in <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>the region
of Calvary.&nbsp; I have come to fulfil the promise, to endow the
disciples with power from on high, and finish the work which the
Son of God has begun.&rdquo;&nbsp; See those tongues of flame
sitting upon the fishermen of Galilee; while strangers from many
different countries hear from them, each in his own language,
&ldquo;the wonderful works of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only think of
three thousand conversions in a day&mdash;under a single
sermon.&nbsp; Three thousand hearts were wounded by the arrows of
Divine love, through the strongest breastplate ever made in
hell.&nbsp; This was the work of the Holy Spirit, taking of the
things of Christ and showing them to the disciples.&nbsp; It was
Christ himself, manifesting himself through his agent.&nbsp; The
first promise brought the Messiah into the world in the flesh;
the second, in the Spirit&mdash;the first, to be crucified; the
second, to crucify the sins of his people&mdash;the first, to
empty himself; the second, to fill the believer with heavenly
gifts and graces&mdash;the first, to sanctify himself as a
sin-offering upon the altar; the second, to give repentance and
pardon as a Prince and a Saviour.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is still on earth, prosecuting his gracious
work, and communicating his heavenly gifts.&nbsp; He strives with
sinners, and quickens believers into spiritual life.&nbsp; He
dwells in the saints, leads them into all truth, and bears
witness with their spirits that they are the Children of
God.&nbsp; He illuminates their understanding, subdues their
will, purifies their thoughts, and plants within them all holy
principles and affections.&nbsp; And this he does, not by an
audible voice from heaven, but through the instrumentality of the
word, and by secret impressions upon the soul.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it
goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The operations of the Holy Ghost are seen only in their
effects.&nbsp; It is a drop of water becoming a fountain
&ldquo;that springeth up unto everlasting life.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is a spark of fire, kindling a conflagration, which all the
rivers of Belial cannot quench.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost is the Paraclete; that is, the
Counselor and Consoler.&nbsp; In our text, he is called the
&ldquo;Comforter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And I will pray the Father,
and he shall give you another Comforter,&rdquo;&mdash;according
to the original, one to plead your cause.&nbsp; The word is the
same as that used to designate the Roman ambassadors, who <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>were sent
to other countries, as representatives of the Roman power, to
persuade enemies to submit, or offer terms of peace.</p>
<p>A certain author observes, that the office of the Comforter is
to reconcile enemies, and invigorate friends&mdash;to console the
dejected, strengthen the enfeebled, and support the people of God
in all the conflicts and trials of life.&nbsp; It is by his grace
that the believer&rsquo;s youth is renewed as the eagle&rsquo;s,
and all his languishing virtues are revived, so that he can
&ldquo;run and not weary&mdash;walk and not faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another part of his office in the Church is
intercession.&nbsp; As he pleads with sinners on behalf of Christ
in the gospel, so he pleads for believers in the court of heaven;
not personally, like our blessed Lord, but by inspiring the
spirit of supplication in their hearts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Likewise the
Spirit also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we
should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered; and
he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according
to the will of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When other nations had offended the Romans, it was common for
them, fearing the revenge of that mighty empire, to send
messengers to Rome, to plead their cause, and treat for
peace.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Spirit of Truth,&rdquo; having brought
sinners to repentance by pleading with them for Christ in the
gospel, pours down upon them the spirit of grace and
supplication, so that they cry out for mercy, and this is
virtually the Spirit of God crying out within them.&nbsp; What is
the meaning of all that prayer and agony in the
congregation?&nbsp; The Spirit of God is there.&nbsp; His hammer
has broken the rock&mdash;his fire has melted the iron.&nbsp; No
other power could conquer those proud rebellious hearts, and turn
the blasphemer into a man of prayer.&nbsp; Listen!&nbsp;
&ldquo;If thou shouldst mark iniquity, O Lord, who could
stand?&rdquo;&nbsp; Hark again!&nbsp; &ldquo;But thou art a God
ready to pardon; there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest
be feared.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the voice of the Spirit, pleading
in the awakened soul.&nbsp; See that publican in the temple,
smiting upon his breast, and saying,&mdash;&ldquo;God be merciful
to me a sinner!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Holy Ghost has both convinced
him of sin, and inspired him to pray for mercy.&nbsp; No other
agency can thus quicken the &ldquo;dead in trespasses and
sins,&rdquo; and turn the hearts of the children of men to the
Lord.&nbsp; The gospel, <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>in the hand of the Holy Spirit,
&ldquo;is the power of God unto salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Holy
Spirit can convince the world&mdash;can rend the veil from the
mind, and dissolve the ice around the heart.&nbsp; He applies the
truth to the conscience, and makes the guilty read their own
sentence of condemnation by the light of the fires of Sinai; and
then he shows them the atoning blood, and prompts them to pray
for pardon.&nbsp; He first convinces them that they are sinking
in &ldquo;the horrible pit of miry clay;&rdquo; and then lets
down to them the rope of the promise, bids them take hold by
faith, draws them out, and sets their feet upon a rock, and puts
into their mouth the new song of salvation&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord, I
will praise thee; for though thou wast angry with me, thine anger
is turned away, and thou comfortest me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O that the &ldquo;Spirit of grace and supplication&rdquo; may
ever rest upon us!&nbsp; May we plead for ourselves with God, as
Jacob, when he wrestled for the blessing; or Bartimeus, when he
besought the Saviour to restore his sight!&nbsp; May we plead for
sinners, as Abraham for Sodom, as Moses for Israel, as Daniel for
the captives, as the Centurion for his servant, and as the woman
of Canaan for her daughter!</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost is called &ldquo;another
comforter;&rdquo; which suggests a difference between his office
in the church, and that of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Christ, by his personal ministry on earth, was the Comforter
of his little flock; and by his death upon the cross, the
procurer of all the comforts of them that believe; and when he
ascended, &ldquo;another comforter&rdquo; came down to take his
place in the church, and communicate the blessings which he
bought with his blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man sin, we have an
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;&rdquo; who
hath &ldquo;entered into heaven itself, there to appear in the
presence of God for us;&rdquo; while his agent and representative
on earth dwells with his followers, leads them into all truth,
and carries on within them the process of sanctification.&nbsp;
Both are comforters&mdash;both are advocates&mdash;Christ above,
and the Holy Spirit below&mdash;Christ by his personal presence
before the Father, and the Holy Spirit by his gracious influence
in the believer&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Christ is making intercession on our behalf without us, and
independently of us.&nbsp; But the Holy Spirit is making
intercession through <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>us&mdash;pleading in our prayers
&ldquo;with groanings that cannot be uttered.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
never acts without us.&nbsp; True repentance and faith are his
gifts, but they are also our exercises.&nbsp; He draws us to
Christ, but we must yield to his attractions.&nbsp; He inspires
us to pray, but the act of prayer is our own.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;worketh in us to will and to do of his good
pleasure,&rdquo; but he does not will and do for us.&nbsp; He
gives us the life and the power, but he requires us to use
them.&nbsp; He leads us into all truth, but not unless we follow
him.&nbsp; He sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts, but not
unless we open our hearts to receive the communication.&nbsp; He
destroys the old man within us, and creates the new; but not
unless we cordially resign ourselves to his influence, and
earnestly co-operate with his grace.</p>
<p>Christ in heaven pleads for the reconciliation of sinners to
God.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit on earth awakens sinners, convinces
them of sin, draws them to the throne of grace, and breathes into
them intense prayers for pardon.&nbsp; He renews them, and
purifies them, and makes them temples of his grace, and heirs of
glory.&nbsp; He opens the blind eyes, and unstops the deaf ears,
and makes the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
dumb to sing.&nbsp; All the true conversions ever effected on
earth are the results of his gracious power.</p>
<p>Christ has bound up all the covenants, and carried them with
him into heaven, and laid them down before the throne, having
obtained eternal redemption for us; and the Holy Spirit has taken
of the things of God, and brought them down to men.&nbsp; Christ
received gifts for us, and the Holy Spirit confers them upon
us.&nbsp; Christ receives from the Father; the Spirit receives
from Christ; and we receive from the Spirit.&nbsp; Christ bought
the church with his own blood, and the spirit prepares and
presents her to him as his bride.&nbsp; Christ opened a way into
the Holy of Holies, and the Spirit aids us to offer our
sacrifices before the mercy-seat.&nbsp; Christ is the appointed
medium of our intercourse with God, and the Spirit helps us to
avail ourselves of that unspeakable privilege.&nbsp; Christ in
heaven is the life of our redemption, and the Spirit upon earth
is the life of the gospel and the ordinances.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
draw all men unto myself&rdquo;&mdash;is the motto of Christ;
&ldquo;I will draw all men unto Christ&rdquo;&mdash;is the motto
of the Spirit.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost has taken up his permanent residence
among <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>the people of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;That he may abide with
you for ever&mdash;for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His miraculous gifts were temporary; being no longer
necessary, when the truth was established in the conviction of
mankind.&nbsp; But his renovating and sanctifying grace is as
much needed now as ever, and therefore has never been taken from
the world.&nbsp; The primitive Christians, and Christians of the
present day, in this respect, share the same privilege.&nbsp; It
is a &ldquo;common salvation;&rdquo; and the streams will never
cease to flow, while there remain &ldquo;vessels of mercy&rdquo;
to be filled.</p>
<p>The church in every age has suffered great loss in the death
of her most able and efficient ministers.&nbsp; The strongest
pillars in the house have fallen; the tallest trees in the forest
have been cut down.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fathers, where are they? and
the prophets, do they live for ever?&rdquo;&nbsp; Where are the
apostles and evangelists?&nbsp; What has become of the great
reformers of every age?&nbsp; They have gone the way whence they
shall not return.&nbsp; They have ascended in their chariots of
fire.&nbsp; Though safe in heaven, they are lost to earth.&nbsp;
But the Holy Spirit is a &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; that shall
&ldquo;abide with you for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hands have all
departed, one after another, and new crews have been shipped from
age to age; but the Captain is still alive; and has remained on
board, ever since he first took the register and the compass, on
the day of Pentecost; and will never leave the ship, till he
brings her in from her last voyage, and lays her up for ever!</p>
<p>Brethren in the ministry! this is our consolation.&nbsp; The
Spirit that blessed the labors of David Jones, Daniel Rowlands,
and Howell Harris, still &ldquo;dwelleth with you, and shall be
in you.&rdquo;&nbsp; O let us seek his aid in our holy work, and
pray for his outpouring upon our congregations!</p>
<p>Delegates of the different churches! be of good courage!&nbsp;
You may not have seen as many additions lately as in former
times; but the Holy Spirit has not yet departed from the
faithful.&nbsp; You have heard of wonderful revivals in America,
as well as in some parts of Wales.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; is yet at work.&nbsp; The illuminator of
souls is yet at hand.&nbsp; The office is yet open.&nbsp; The
blessing is yet offered.&nbsp; O, let us all pray for the Holy
Spirit! let us look for his coming! let us wait for his
salvation!</p>

THE FATHER AND SON GLORIFIED.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Howbeit</i>, <i>when he</i>, <i>the
Spirit of Truth</i>, <i>is come</i>, <i>he will guide you into
all truth</i>; <i>for he shall not speak of himself</i>; <i>but
whatsoever he shall hear</i>, <i>that shall he speak</i>; <i>and
he will show you things to come</i>.&nbsp; <i>He shall glorify
me</i>: <i>for he shall receive of mine</i>, <i>and shall show it

mine</i>; <i>therefore</i>, <i>said I</i>, <i>that he shall take
of mine</i>, <i>and shall show it unto you</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;John
xvi. 13&ndash;15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wonderful Providence which
brought the Children of Israel out of the house of bondage was a
chain of many links, not one of which could be omitted without
destroying the beauty, and defeating the end of the Divine
economy.&nbsp; The family of Jacob come to Egypt in the time of
famine&mdash;they multiply&mdash;they are oppressed&mdash;their
cries reach to heaven&mdash;God manifests himself in the burning
bush&mdash;Moses is sent to Egypt&mdash;miracles are wrought by
his hand&mdash;Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart is hardened&mdash;the
first-born are slain&mdash;the passover is eaten&mdash;the people
depart, led by the pillar of God&mdash;the sea is
divided&mdash;and with many signs and wonders, the thousands of
Israel are conducted through the wilderness to the Promised
Land.&nbsp; Had one of these links been wanting, the chain of
deliverance had been defective.</p>
<p>So, in the salvation of sinners by Jesus Christ, all the
conditions and preparatives were essential to the completeness
and glory of the scheme.&nbsp; The Son of God must consent to
undertake our cause, and become our substitute&mdash;the promise
must be given to Adam, and frequently repeated to the
patriarchs&mdash;bloody sacrifices must be instituted to typify
the vicarious sufferings of Messiah&mdash;a long line of prophets
must foretell his advent, and the glory of his kingdom&mdash;<a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>he must be
born in Bethlehem, crucified on Calvary, and buried in
Joseph&rsquo;s new tomb&mdash;must rise from the dead, ascend to
the right hand of the Father, and send down the Holy Spirit to
guide and sanctify his church.&nbsp; Without all these
circumstances, the economy of redemption would have been
incomplete and inefficient.</p>
<p>The last link in the chain is the mission and work of the Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; This is quite as important as any of the
rest.&nbsp; Our Saviour&rsquo;s heart seems to have been much set
upon it during all his ministry, and especially during the last
few days before his crucifixion.&nbsp; He spoke of it frequently
to his disciples, and told them that he would not leave them
comfortless, but would send them &ldquo;another Comforter,&rdquo;
who should abide with them for ever; and that his own departure
was necessary, to prepare the way for the coming of the heavenly
Paraclete.&nbsp; In our text, he describes the office of the Holy
Spirit, and the specific relation which he sustains to the work
of salvation:&mdash;&ldquo;Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of Truth,
is come, he will guide you into all truth; for he shall not speak
of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak;
and he will show you things to come.&nbsp; He shall glorify me;
for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.&nbsp;
All things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said I, that
he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words teach us two important truths&mdash;<i>first</i>,
That the Son is equal with the Father; and <i>secondly</i>, That
the Father and the Son are alike glorified in the economy of
salvation.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The Son claims equality with the Father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All things that the Father hath are mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sentence is very comprehensive and sublime&mdash;an
unquestionable affirmation of Messiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;eternal
power and Godhead.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same doctrine is taught us in
many other recorded sayings of Christ, and sustained by all the
prophets and apostles; and when I consider this declaration in
connection with the general strain of the inspired writers on the
subject, I seem to hear the Saviour himself addressing the world
in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things that the Father hath are mine.&nbsp; His
<i>names</i> are mine.&nbsp; I am Jehovah&mdash;the Mighty God,
and the Everlasting Father&mdash;the Lord of Hosts&mdash;the
Living God&mdash;the True God, and Eternal Life.</p>
<p><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>&ldquo;His <i>works</i> are mine.&nbsp; All things were
made by me, and I uphold all things by the word of my
power.&nbsp; My Father worketh hitherto, and I work; for as the
Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son
quickeneth whom he will.&nbsp; I am the author of universal
being, and my hand moves all the machinery of providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His <i>honors</i> are mine.&nbsp; I have an
indisputable right to the homage of all created
intelligences.&nbsp; I inhabit the praises of eternity.&nbsp;
Before the foundation of the world, I was the object of angelic
adoration; and when I became incarnate as a Saviour, the Father
published his decree in heaven, saying:&mdash;&lsquo;Let all the
angels of God worship him!&rsquo;&nbsp; It is his will, also,
that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the
Father&mdash;in the same manner, and the same degree.&nbsp; He
that honoreth the Son, honoreth the Father; and he that honoreth
not the Son, honoreth not the Father: for I and my Father are
one&mdash;one in honor&mdash;possessing joint interest and
authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His <i>attributes</i> are mine.&nbsp; Though as man and
mediator I am inferior to the Father; yet my nature is no more
inferior to his, than the nature of the Prince of Wales is
inferior to the nature of the King of England.&nbsp; You see me
clothed in humanity; but in my original state, I thought it not
robbery to be equal with God.&nbsp; I was in the beginning with
God, and possessed the same eternity of being.&nbsp; Like him, I
am almighty, omniscient, and immutable; infinite in holiness,
justice, goodness, and truth.&nbsp; All these attributes, with
every other possible perfection, belong to me in the same sense
as they belong to the Father.&nbsp; They are absolute and
independent, underived and unoriginated&mdash;the essential
qualities of my nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His <i>riches of grace</i> are mine.&nbsp; I am the
mediator of the new covenant&mdash;the channel of my
Father&rsquo;s mercies to mankind.&nbsp; I have the keys of the
house of David, and the seal of the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; I
have come from the bosom of the Father, freighted with the
precious treasures of his good will to men.&nbsp; I have sailed
over the sea of tribulation and death, to bring you the wealth of
the other world.&nbsp; I am the Father&rsquo;s messenger,
publishing peace on earth&mdash;a peace which I have purchased
with my own blood upon the cross.&nbsp; It hath pleased the
Father that in me all fulness should <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>dwell&mdash;all fulness of wisdom
and grace&mdash;whatever is necessary for the justification,
sanctification, and redemption of them that believe.&nbsp; My
Father and I are one in the work of salvation, as in the work of
creation.&nbsp; We have the same will, and the same intention of
mercy toward the children of the great captivity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>objects of his love</i> are mine.&nbsp; He hath
given them to me in an everlasting covenant.&nbsp; He hath given
me the heathen for an inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
earth for a possession.&nbsp; They were mine by the original
right of creation; but now they are doubly mine by the superadded
claim of redemption.&nbsp; My Father, before the world was, gave
me a charter of all the souls I would redeem.&nbsp; I have
fulfilled the condition.&nbsp; I have poured out my soul unto
death, and sealed the covenant with the blood of my cross.&nbsp;
Therefore all believers are mine.&nbsp; I have bought them with a
price.&nbsp; I have redeemed them from the bondage of sin and
death.&nbsp; Their names are engraven on my hands and my
feet.&nbsp; They are written with the soldier&rsquo;s spear upon
my heart.&nbsp; And of all that the Father hath given me, I will
lose nothing.&nbsp; I will draw them all to myself; I will raise
them up at the last day; and they shall be with me where I am,
that they may behold my glory&mdash;the glory which I had with
the Father before the foundation of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The Father and the Son are equally glorified in the
economy of redemption, and the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Son glorifies the Father.&nbsp; I hear him
praying in the garden:&mdash;&ldquo;Father, I have glorified thee
on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hear him again, amid the supernatural gloom of
Calvary, with a voice that rings through the dominions of death
and hell, crying&mdash;&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What mighty achievement hast thou finished to-day, blessed
Jesus? and how have thy unknown agony and shameful death
glorified the Father?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have glorified the Father, by raising up those
precious things which fell in Eden, and were lost in the
abyss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have raised up my Father&rsquo;s <i>law</i>.&nbsp; I
found it cast down to the earth, and trampled into the
dust.&nbsp; I have magnified and made it honorable.&nbsp; I have
vindicated its authority in the sight of men and angels.&nbsp; I
have satisfied its demands on behalf of my redeemed, <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>and become
the end of the law for righteousness to all who will receive me
as their surety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have raised up my Father&rsquo;s <i>name</i>.&nbsp; I
have declared it to my brethren.&nbsp; I have manifested it to
the men whom he has given me.&nbsp; I have given a new revelation
of his character to the world.&nbsp; I have shown him to sinners,
as a just God and a Saviour.&nbsp; I have restored his worship in
purity and spirituality upon earth.&nbsp; I have opened a new and
living way to his throne of grace.&nbsp; I have written the
record of his mercy with my own blood upon the rocks of
Calvary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have raised up my Father&rsquo;s <i>image</i>.&nbsp;
I have imprinted it afresh upon human nature, from which it was
effaced by sin.&nbsp; I have displayed its excellence in my own
character.&nbsp; I have passed through the pollutions of the
world, and the territory of death, without tarnishing its lustre,
or injuring its symmetry.&nbsp; Though my visage is marred with
grief, and my back plowed with scourges, and my hands and feet
nailed to the accursed cross, not one trace of my Father&rsquo;s
image has been obliterated from my human soul.&nbsp; It is as
perfect and as spotless now as when I lay in the manger.&nbsp; I
will carry it unstained with me into heaven.&nbsp; I will give a
full description of it in my gospel upon earth.&nbsp; I will
change my people into the same image from glory to glory.&nbsp; I
will also renovate and transform their vile bodies, and fashion
them like unto my own glorious body.&nbsp; I will ransom them
from the power of the grave; and because I live, they shall live
also&mdash;the counterpart of my own immaculate
humanity&mdash;mirrors to reflect my Father&rsquo;s glory for
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Father glorifies the Son.&nbsp; He prayed in the
garden:&mdash;&ldquo;And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine
own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world
was.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was the petition granted?&nbsp; Answer, ye
Roman sentinels, who watched his sepulchre!&nbsp; Answer, ye men
of Galilee, who gazed upon his chariot, as he ascended from the
Mount of Olives!</p>
<p>The glorification of the Son by the Father implies all the
honors of his mediatorial office&mdash;all the crowns which he
won by his victory over the powers of death and hell.&nbsp; The
Father raised him from the dead, and received him up into glory,
as a testimony of his acceptance as the sinner&rsquo;s
surety&mdash;an expression of perfect <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>satisfaction with his vicarious
sacrifice upon the cross.&nbsp; It was the just reward of his
work; it was the fruit of his gracious travail.&nbsp; He is
&ldquo;crowned with glory and honor for the sufferings of
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because he hath poured out his soul
unto death,&rdquo; therefore &ldquo;God also hath highly exalted
him, and given him a name that is above every name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What an honor would it be to a man, to receive eight or ten of
the highest offices in a kingdom!&nbsp; Infinitely greater is the
glory of Emmanuel.&nbsp; His name includes all the offices and
titles of the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; The Father hath made him
&ldquo;both Lord and Christ&rdquo;&mdash;that is, given him the
supreme prerogatives of government and salvation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Him hath God exalted to be a prince and a Saviour, to give
repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is
&ldquo;head over all things in the church&rdquo;&mdash;Prime
Minister of the kingdom of heaven&mdash;Lord Treasurer,
dispensing the bounties of Divine grace to mankind&mdash;Lord
High-Chancellor of the realm, and Keeper of the Great Seal of the
living God; holding in his hand the charter of our redemption,
and certifying the authenticity of the Divine covenant&mdash;Lord
Chief Justice of heaven and earth, having all power and authority
to administer the laws of Providence throughout the
universe&mdash;the Chief Prince&mdash;the General of the
army&mdash;the Captain of the Lord&rsquo;s host&mdash;the
Champion who conquered Satan, Sin, and Death; bruising the head
of the first, destroying the power of the second, and swallowing
up the third in victory.&nbsp; He hath the keys of hell and of
death.&nbsp; He shutteth, and no man openeth; he openeth, and no
man shutteth.&nbsp; He bears all the honors of his Father&rsquo;s
house; and concentrates in himself all the glories of Supreme
Divinity, redeemed humanity, and &ldquo;mediator between God and
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit glorifies Father and Son
together.&nbsp; He is procured for the world by the blood of the
Son, and sent into the world by the authority of the Father; so
that both are alike represented in his mission, and equally
glorified in his office.&nbsp; The gracious things which the
Father gave into the hands of the Son when he descended from
heaven, the Son gave into the hands of the Spirit when he
returned to heaven.&nbsp; &ldquo;All things that the Father hath
are mine; and he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>This
is the object of the Spirit&rsquo;s advent, the communication of
the things of Christ to men.&nbsp; What are the things of
Christ?&nbsp; His merit, his mercy, his image, his gospel, his
promises, all the gifts of his grace, all the treasures of his
love, and all the immunities of eternal redemption.&nbsp; These
the Father hath given to the Son, as the great Trustee of the
church; and the Son hath given them to the Spirit, as the
appointed agent of their communication.</p>
<p>A ship was laden in India, arrived safe in London, unloaded
her precious cargo, and the goods were soon distributed all over
the country, and offered for sale in a thousand stores.&nbsp; The
Son of God brought immense riches of Divine grace from heaven to
earth, which are all left to the disposal of the Holy Spirit, and
freely proffered to the perishing wherever the gospel is
preached.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit came not to construct a new engine of mercy,
but to propel that already constructed by Christ.&nbsp; Its first
revolution rent the rocks of Calvary, and shook the rocky hearts
of men.&nbsp; Its second revolution demolished the throne of
death, burst his prison-doors, and liberated many of his
captives.&nbsp; Its third revolution carried its builder up into
the heaven of heavens, and brought down the Holy Spirit to move
its machinery for ever.&nbsp; Its next revolution, under the
impulse of this new Agent, was like &ldquo;the rushing of a
mighty wind&rdquo; among the assembled disciples at Jerusalem,
kindled a fire upon the head of every Christian, inspired them to
speak all the languages of the babbling earth, and killed and
quickened three thousand souls of the hearers.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is still on earth, glorifying the Father and
the Son.&nbsp; He convinces the world of sin.&nbsp; He leads men
to Christ, through the rivers of corruption, the mountains of
presumption, and the terrible bogs of despair, affording them no
rest till they come to the city of refuge.&nbsp; He continues on
the field to bring up the rear; while the Captain of our
Salvation, on his white horse, rides victorious in the van of
battle.&nbsp; He strengthens the soldiers&mdash;&ldquo;faint, yet
pursuing;&rdquo; raises the fallen; encourages the despondent;
feeds them with the bread of life, and the new wine of the
kingdom; and leads them on&mdash;&ldquo;conquering, and to
conquer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His work will not be finished till the resurrection.&nbsp;
Then will he quicken our mortal bodies.&nbsp; Then will he light
his candle, and <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>sweep the house till he find every lost piece of
silver.&nbsp; Then will he descend into the dark caves of death,
and gather all the gems of redeemed humanity, and weave them into
a crown for Emmanuel, and place that crown upon Emmanuel&rsquo;s
head, amid the songs of the adoring seraphim!</p>
<p>Thus the Holy Spirit glorifies the Father and the Son.&nbsp;
Let us pray for the outpouring of his grace upon the
church.&nbsp; In proportion to his manifestation in our hearts,
will be our &ldquo;knowledge of the light of the glory of God in
the face of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor is this all; in
proportion to the visitations of the Holy Spirit, will be the
purity of our lives, the spirituality of our worship, the ardor
of our zeal and charity, and the extent of our usefulness to the
cause of Christ.&nbsp; Would you see a revival of religion? pray
for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon you, to sanctify your
hearts and your lives, that your light may &ldquo;so shine before
men, that others may see your good works, and glorify your Father
who is in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of
the mulberry trees, then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then the
Lord shall go out before thee, to strike the hosts of the
Philistines.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brethren, this is the time.&nbsp; The
mulberry trees are shaking.&nbsp; God is going before his people,
to prepare their way to victory.&nbsp; The hand of Divine
Providence is opening a great and effectual door for the
gospel.&nbsp; The mountains are levelled, the valleys are
exalted, and a highway is cast up in the wilderness for our
God.&nbsp; The arts of printing and navigation, the increasing
commerce of the world, the general prevalence of the spirit of
peace, the rapid march of literature and science, and the
correspondence of eminent and leading men in every nation, are so
many preparatives for the moral conquest of the world.&nbsp; The
Captain of our Salvation, on the white horse of the gospel, can
now ride through Europe and America: and will soon lead forth his
army to take possession of Asia and Africa.&nbsp; The wings of
the mighty angel are unbound, and he is flying in the midst of
heaven.</p>
<p>Again: Christians are better informed concerning the moral
state of the world than formerly.&nbsp; If my neighbor&rsquo;s
house were on fire, and I knew nothing of it, I could not be
blamed for rendering him no assistance; but who could be
guiltless in beholding the <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>building in flames, without an
effort to rescue its occupants?&nbsp; Brethren, you have heard of
the perishing heathen.&nbsp; You have heard of their dreadful
superstitions, their human sacrifices, and their abominable
rites.&nbsp; You have heard of Juggernaut, and the River Ganges,
and the murder of infants, and the immolation of widows, and the
worship of idols and demons.&nbsp; You know something of the
delusion of Mohammedism, the cruel and degrading ignorance of
Popery, and how millions around you are perishing for lack of
knowledge.&nbsp; Do you feel no solicitude for their
souls&mdash;no desire to pluck them as brands from the
burning?</p>
<p>What can we do?&nbsp; The Scriptures have been translated into
nearly all the languages of the babbling earth.&nbsp;
Missionaries have gone into many lands&mdash;have met the Indian
in his wigwam, the African in his Devil&rsquo;s-bush, and the
devotee on his way to Mecca.&nbsp; We can furnish more men for
the field, and more money to sustain them.&nbsp; But these things
cannot change and renovate the human heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not by
might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the grand regenerating agency.&nbsp;
He alone can convince and save the world.&nbsp; His aid is given
in answer to prayer; and the Father is more ready to give than we
are to ask.</p>
<p>Mr. Ward, one of the Baptist missionaries in India, in a
missionary discourse at Bristol, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Brethren, we
need your money, but we need your prayers more.&rdquo;&nbsp; O,
what encouragement we have to pray for our missionaries!&nbsp;
Thus saith the Lord:&mdash;&ldquo;I will pour water upon him that
is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit
upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Let us plead with God for the accomplishment of the
promise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not
silence, and give him no rest till he make Jerusalem a praise in
the whole earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brethren in the ministry! let us remember that all our success
depends upon the aid of the Holy Spirit, and let us pray
constantly for his blessing upon the word!&nbsp; Brethren in the
church! forget not the connection between the work of the Holy
Spirit and the glory of your Best Friend, and earnestly entreat
him to mingle his sanctifying unction with the treasures of
Divine Truth contained in these earthen vessels!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Finally, brethren, pray for <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>us; that the word of the Lord may
have free course and be glorified;&rdquo; and all the ends of the
earth see the salvation of our God!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hasten, Lord, the glorious time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When, beneath Messiah&rsquo;s sway,<br />
Every tribe, in every clime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall the gospel call obey!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then shall wars and tumults cease;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then be banished grief and pain<br />
Righteousness, and joy, and peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Undisturbed, for ever reign!&rdquo;</p>

287</span>EXTRACTS.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE DEMONIAC OF GADARA.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Luke</i> viii. 26&ndash;39.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And</span> when he went forth to
land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had
devils a long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any
house, but in the tombs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I imagine that this demoniac was not only an object of pity,
but he was really a terror in the country.&nbsp; So terrific was
his appearance, so dreadful and hideous his screams, so
formidable, frightful, and horrid his wild career, that all the
women in that region were so much alarmed that none of them dared
go to market.</p>
<p>And what made him still more terrible was the place of his
abode: It was not in a city, where some attention might be paid
to order and decorum&mdash;(though he would sometimes ramble into
the city as in this case.)&nbsp; It was not in a town, or
village, or any house whatever, where assistance might be
obtained in case of necessity; but it was among the tombs, and in
the wilderness&mdash;not far, however, from the turnpike
road.&nbsp; No one could tell but that he might jump at them,
like a panther, and scare them to death.&nbsp; The gloominess of
the place made it more awful and solemn.&nbsp; It was among the
tombs&mdash;where, in the opinion of some, all witches,
corpse-candles, and hobgoblins abide.</p>
<p>One day, however, Mary was determined that no such nuisance
should be suffered in the country of the Gadarenes.&nbsp; The man
must be clothed, though he was mad and crazy.&nbsp; And if he
should at any future time strip himself, tie up his clothes in a
bundle, throw them into the river, and tell them to go to see
Abraham, he must <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>be tied and taken care of.&nbsp; Well, this was all
right&mdash;no sooner said than done.&nbsp; But, so soon as the
fellow was bound in chains and fetters, Samson-like, he broke the
bands asunder, and could not be tamed.</p>
<p>By this time, the devil became offended with the Gadarenes,
and in a pout he took the demoniac away, and drove him into the
wilderness.&nbsp; He thought the Gadarenes had no business to
interfere and meddle with his property; for he had possession of
the man.&nbsp; And he knew, that &ldquo;a bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is probable that he wanted
to send him home; for there was no knowing what might happen
now-a-days.&nbsp; But there was too much matter about him to send
him as he was; therefore, he thought the best plan would be to
persuade him to commit suicide by cutting his throat.&nbsp; But
here Satan was at a nonplus&mdash;his rope was too short&mdash;He
could not turn executioner himself, as that would not have
answered the design he has in view, when he wants people to
commit suicide; for the act would have been his own sin and not
the man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The poor demoniac, therefore, must go
about to hunt a sharp stone, or any thing that he could
get.&nbsp; He might have been in search of such an article, when
he returned from the wilderness into the city, whence he came
when he met the Son of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
man.&nbsp; And when he saw Jesus he cried out, and fell down
before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with
thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high?&nbsp; I beseech thee
torment me not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is the devil&rsquo;s confession of faith.&nbsp; The
devils believe and tremble, while men make a mock of sin, and
sport on the brink of eternal ruin.&nbsp; To many of the human
race, Christ appears as a root out of dry ground.&nbsp; They see
in him neither form nor comeliness, and there is no beauty in him
that they should desire him.&nbsp; Some said he was the
carpenter&rsquo;s son, and would not believe in him; others said
he had a devil, and that it was through Beelzebub the chief of
the devils, that he cast out devils; some cried out, Let him be
crucified&mdash;let him be crucified; and others said, Let his
blood be on us and on our children.&nbsp; As the Jews would not
have him to reign over them; so many, who call themselves
Christians, say that he is a mere man; as such, he has no right
to rule over their consciences, and demand their obedience,
adoration, and praise.&nbsp; But Diabolus knows
better&mdash;Jesus is the Son of God most high.</p>
<p>Many of the children of the devil, whose work they do, differ
<a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>very
widely from their father in their sentiments respecting the
person of Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus commanded the legion of unclean spirits to come
out of the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; They knew that out they must
go.&nbsp; But they were like Scotchmen&mdash;very unwilling to
return to their own country.&nbsp; They would rather go into
hogs&rsquo; skins than to their own country.&nbsp; And he
suffered them to go into the herd of swine.&nbsp; Methinks that
one of the men who fed the hogs, kept a better look out than the
rest of them, and said, &ldquo;What ail the hogs?&nbsp; Look
sharp there, boys&mdash;keep them in&mdash;make good use of your
whips.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you run?&nbsp; Why, I declare, one
of them has gone over the cliff!&nbsp; There goes another!&nbsp;
Drive them back.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never was there such a running, and
whipping, and hallooing; but down go the hogs, before they are
aware of it.&nbsp; One of them said, &ldquo;They are all
gone!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sure not all gone into the
sea!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, every one of them, the black hog
and all!&nbsp; They are all drowned!&mdash;the devil is in
them!&nbsp; What shall we do now?&mdash;what can we say to the
owners?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What can we say?&rdquo; said
another.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must tell the truth&mdash;that is all
about it.&nbsp; We did our best&mdash;all that was in our
power.&nbsp; What could any man do more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went their way to the city, to tell the masters what
had happened.&nbsp; &ldquo;John, where are you going,&rdquo;
exclaimed one of the masters.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir, did you know the
demoniac that was among the tombs there?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Demoniac among the tombs!&nbsp; Where did you leave the
hogs?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That madman, sir&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Madman!&mdash;Why do you come home without the
hogs?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That wild and furious man, sir, that
mistress was afraid of so much&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
John, I ask you a plain and simple question&mdash;why don&rsquo;t
you answer me?&nbsp; Where are the hogs?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That
man who was possessed with the devils, sir&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, sure enough, you are crazy!&mdash;you look
wild!&mdash;tell me your story, if you can, let it be what it
may.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesus Christ, sir, has cast out the
unclean spirits out of the demoniac; they are gone into the
swine; and they are all drowned in the sea; for I saw the tail of
the last one!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Gadarenes went out to see what was
done, and finding that it was even so, they were afraid, and
besought Jesus to depart from them.</p>
<p>How awful must be the condition of those men who love the
things of this world more than Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>The man out of whom the unclean spirits were cast, besought
Jesus that he might be with him.&nbsp; But he told him to return
to his <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>own house, and show how great things God had done unto
him.&nbsp; And he went his way and published throughout the whole
city of Decapolis, how great things Jesus had done unto
him.&nbsp; The act of Jesus casting so many devils out of him,
was sufficient to persuade him that Jesus was God as well as
man.</p>
<p>I imagine I see him going through the city,
crying&mdash;&ldquo;O yes!&nbsp; O yes!&nbsp; O yes!&mdash;Please
to take notice of me, the demoniac among the tombs.&nbsp; I am
the man who was a terror to the citizens of this place&mdash;that
wild man, who would wear no clothes, and that no man could
bind.&nbsp; Here am I, now, in my right mind.&nbsp; Jesus Christ,
the friend of sinners, had compassion on me.&nbsp; He remembered
me when I was in my low estate&mdash;when there was no eye to
pity, and no hand to save.&nbsp; He cast out the devils and
redeemed my soul from destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most wonderful must have been the surprise of the people, to
hear such proclamation.&nbsp; The ladies running to the windows,
the shoemakers throwing their lasts one way and their awls
another, running out to meet him and to converse with him, that
they might be positive there was no imposition, and found it to
be a fact that could not be contradicted.&nbsp; &ldquo;O, the
wonder of all wonders!&nbsp; Never was there such a
thing!&rdquo;&mdash;must, I think, be the general
conversation.</p>
<p>And while they are talking and everybody having something to
say, homeward goes the man.&nbsp; As soon as he comes in sight of
the house, I imagine I see one of the children running in, and
crying, &ldquo;O, mother! father is coming&mdash;he will kill us
all!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Children, come all into the
house,&rdquo; says the mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us fasten the
doors.&nbsp; I think there is no sorrow like my sorrow!&rdquo;
says the broken-hearted woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are all the windows
fastened, children?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mary, my dear, come from the window&mdash;don&rsquo;t be
standing there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, mother, I can hardly
believe it is father!&nbsp; That man is
well-dressed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O yes, my dear children, it is
your own father.&nbsp; I knew him by his walk the moment I saw
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another child stepping to the window, says,
&ldquo;Why, mother, I never saw father coming home as he does
to-day.&nbsp; He walks on the footpath and turns round the corner
of the fence.&nbsp; He used to come towards the house as straight
as a line, over fences, ditches, and hedges; and I never saw him
walking as slow as he does now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments, however, he arrives at the door of the
house, to the great terror and consternation of all the
inmates.&nbsp; He gently tries the door, and finds no
admittance.&nbsp; He pauses a moment, steps towards the window,
and says in a low, firm, and melodious voice&mdash;<a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>&ldquo;My
dear wife, if you will let me in, there is no danger.&nbsp; I
will not hurt you.&nbsp; I bring you glad tidings of great
joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The door is reluctantly opened, as it were
between joy and fear.&nbsp; Having deliberately seated himself,
he says: &ldquo;I am come to show you what great things God has
done for me.&nbsp; He loved me with an eternal love.&nbsp; He
redeemed me from the curse of the law and the threatenings of
vindictive justice.&nbsp; He saved me from the power and the
dominion of sin.&nbsp; He cast out the devils out of my heart,
and made that heart, which was a den of thieves, the temple of
the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; I cannot tell you how much I love the
Saviour.&nbsp; Jesus Christ is the foundation of my hope, the
object of my faith, and the centre of my affections.&nbsp; I can
venture my immortal soul upon him.&nbsp; He is my best
friend.&nbsp; He is altogether lovely&mdash;the chief among ten
thousand.&nbsp; He is my wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
and redemption.&nbsp; There is enough in him to make a poor
sinner rich, and a miserable sinner happy.&nbsp; His flesh and
blood is my food&mdash;his righteousness my wedding
garment&mdash;and his blood is efficacious to cleanse me from all
my sins.&nbsp; Through him I can obtain eternal life; for he is
the brightness of the Father&rsquo;s glory, and the express image
of his person: in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
bodily.&nbsp; He deserves my highest esteem and my warmest
gratitude.&nbsp; Unto him who loved me with an eternal love, and
washed me in his own blood, unto him be the glory, dominion, and
power, for ever and ever!&nbsp; For he has rescued my soul from
hell.&nbsp; He plucked me as a brand out of the burning.&nbsp; He
took me out of the miry clay, and out of a horrible pit.&nbsp; He
set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings, and put in my
mouth a new song of praise and glory to him!&nbsp; Glory to him
for ever!&mdash;Glory to God in the highest!&mdash;Glory to God
for ever and ever!&nbsp; Let the whole earth praise
him!&mdash;Yea, let all the people praise him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is beyond the power of the strongest imagination to
conceive the joy and gladness of this family.&nbsp; The joy of
seafaring men delivered from shipwreck; the joy of a man
delivered from a burning house; the joy of not being found guilty
to a criminal at the bar; the joy of receiving pardon to a
condemned malefactor; the joy of freedom to a prisoner of war, is
nothing in comparison to the joy of him who is delivered from
going down to the pit of eternal destruction.&nbsp; For it is a
joy unspeakable and full of glory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> language seems to be borrowed
from the case of a ship bringing her passengers to port on a
pleasant afternoon, her sails all white and whole, and her flags
majestically waving in the breeze; while the relatives of those
on board ascend the high places, to see their brothers and their
sisters returning home in safety from the stormy main.&nbsp; How
pleasant to a man who is about to emigrate to the new world,
America, when he meets with some one that has been there, and who
is well acquainted with the coast, knows the best landing-place,
and will accompany him on his passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though I walk
through the valley and the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:
for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He who passed through death himself, and is Lord
of the sea, is our High-priest; and, with his priestly vestments
on, he will stand in Jordan&rsquo;s current till the feeblest in
all the tribes shall be safely landed on Canaan&rsquo;s
shore.&nbsp; How delightful must be the feelings of the dying
Christian, the testimony of whose conscience unites with the
witness of the spirit, to assure him that Jesus has paid his
fare: and who knows he carries in his hand the white stone with
the new name, to be exhibited on the pier-head, the other side,
hard by his Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; This is an abundant
entrance, on a fair day, over a fine sea, with a pleasant breeze
swelling every sail.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now lettest thou thy servant
depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O how different the entrance ministered to the careless
professor&mdash;the fruitless and idle&mdash;who keeps his hand
in his bosom, or leaning upon his implements!&nbsp; Though he may
reach the shore with his life, it will be at midnight, surrounded
by roaring tempests, full of bitter remembrances and most
tormenting fears.&nbsp; Yet, with tattered sails and broken
ropes, peradventure he may gain the port; &ldquo;for the Lord is
good, and his mercy endureth for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; But who shall
<a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>describe
the condition of the ungodly, driven out to sea in all their
wickedness; not even allowed a quarantine within sight of the
heavenly Jerusalem, but obliged to drift about, dismantled and
disabled, amid the darkness of eternal storms!&nbsp; Oh! to be
forced from their moorings at midnight, when they cannot see a
handbreadth before them; the thunders rolling; the lightnings
flashing; strange voices of wrath mingling with every blast; and
the great bell of eternity tolling a funeral knell for the lost
soul, through all its dismal, and solitary, and everlasting
voyage!&nbsp; Let us flee for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set
before us, which hope is as an anchor of the soul, sure and
steadfast, grasping the Rock of Ages within the vail!</p>

294</span>III.&nbsp; THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT IN DRY PLACES.</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">see</span> the wicked spirit, like a
winged dragon, having a long tail, drawing circles and flying in
the air, in search of a dwelling-place.&nbsp; Casting his fiery
look upon a certain neighborhood, he spies a young man, in the
bloom of his days, and in the strength of his powers, sitting on
the box of his cart, going for lime.&nbsp; &ldquo;There he
is,&rdquo; says the old hellish dragon; &ldquo;his veins are full
of blood, and his bones are full of marrow; I will cast the
sparks into his bosom, and will set all his lusts on fire; I will
lead him on from bad to worse, until he commit every sin.&nbsp; I
will make him a murderer, and will plunge his soul for ever
beneath the boiling billows of the great fiery
furnace.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this, I see him descending in all the
vehemence of his character&mdash;but when close by the lad, the
dragon hears him sing,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When on the cross the Saviour hung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mid-day sank in midnight gloom;<br />
When guilty sinners were redeemed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The midnight burst in mid-day bloom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon which the dragon cries out, &ldquo;This place is too dry
for me,&rdquo;&mdash;and away he flies.</p>
<p>I see him again, a second time, hovering in the air, and
seeking for a resting-place.&nbsp; In a flowery meadow, by a
river of clear water, he sees a maiden, eighteen years of age,
among the kine, picking up some beautiful flowers, here and
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold her,&rdquo; says Apollyon, full of
hellish joy; &ldquo;I will poison her mind, and lead her astray
from the paths of the Almighty enemy; I will make her a harlot,
and will ultimately cast her over the precipice, until she sink
for ever in the furnace of divine wrath.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hastens
down; and, approaching the maiden, finds her singing the
following stanzas, in a heavenly, transporting frame of mind, and
with a voice that might almost melt the rocks:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Unto the righteous will arrive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A day of rest serene,<br />
When to their joy they see the Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a vail between.</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>&ldquo;Then from the grave I shall arise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And take my joyful stand<br />
Among the saints who dwell on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Received at God&rsquo;s right hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This place is too dry for me,&rdquo; says the dragon,
and off he flies.</p>
<p>From the meadow he ascends like a great balloon, with renewed
rage, blowing smoke and fire from his mouth, and threatening
damnation to all creation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will have a place to
rest and dwell in,&rdquo; says Apollyon, &ldquo;in spite of the
purpose, covenant, and grace of God!&rdquo;&nbsp; With this he
espies an aged woman, sitting at the door of her cot, and
spinning on her little wheel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, she is ripe for
destruction,&rdquo; says the dragon; &ldquo;I will give her a
taste of the burning gall of damnation, and will cast her into
the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
this he descends on the eaves of the cot, and hears the old
woman, with a trembling voice, but with heavenly feelings, repeat
the following beautiful passage: &ldquo;For the mountains shall
depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not
depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be
removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This place is too dry for me,&rdquo; says the dragon, and
is off again.</p>
<p>It might be thought that all these disappointments would
discourage him from prosecuting his infernal designs farther; but
not so: he is determined, if possible, to find a
dwelling-place.&nbsp; For this purpose he rises again, to mark
some spot where he may alight and find a welcome.&nbsp; He sees
in a small village a neat and decent house of refreshment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;will I dwell, and lead to
bondage every one that shall cross the threshold, and make him
fast in eternal fetters.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He flies down like
lightning, enters the house, and walks into the parlor; but there
he finds a company of ministers of the New Testament, returning
from an Association, who are talking about the victory of
Calvary, and exchanging appointments with each other.&nbsp; The
wicked spirit cannot stay within the sound of their voice, but
retreats with hasty steps, muttering and growling as he
goes,&mdash;&ldquo;This place is too dry for me, I will return to
my house from which I came out!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>IV.&nbsp; SATAN AN ANGEL OF LIGHT.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Satan</span> perceived that it would be
convenient and advantageous for him to have two suits of
clothes.&nbsp; A suit of flaming, impurpled, and blackish red was
his raiment since he instigated the rebellion in heaven: this he
wears at home.&nbsp; This is the garment that is emblematic of
his wrath and cruelty against El-Shaddai.&nbsp; He transformed
himself when he tempted the first Adam, and succeeded in casting
him down.&nbsp; The Second Adam knew him, when he required him to
obey his command, and worship him instead of the true God.&nbsp;
The Second Adam would die, rather than eat bread made out of a
stone by the command of Satan.</p>
<p>It was in his flaming, bloody, black-red garb that Satan
appeared among the persecutors, both pagan and popish, lighting
up the funeral fires of the Martyrs.&nbsp; But he soon found it
necessary to have a suit of white, descriptive of his cunning and
hypocrisy; and he ordered white garments for his servants also,
to wear upon certain occasions, when from home upon his
expeditions.&nbsp; He met with reception in his white robe, angel
like, in many places where he would not have been received at all
in his suit of flaming red-black, in which he took the lead at
pastimes, Sabbath plays, in taverns, and horse-races.&nbsp; But
in his white robe he had an early admittance into many a
cathedral, and he appointed some of his servants to offices
there.</p>
<p>He also, in his white suit, found his way into the houses of
evangelical dissenters, though they profess to have a book which
exhibits his devices.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all the watching that
had been at the doors, he rushed in to the communion table, as he
had done to the consecrated altar of the cathedral, and sowed
discord between the minister and the deacons; and he himself
undertook the managing matters between them, seated in his chair
and vested in his white robe.&nbsp; He forced many to assume a
profession, like tares of the field; and some also of his best
beloved servants, who were utterly destitute of the love of
Christ and the fear of God, he raised into the <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>pulpit,
while they were living in secret sins; but they all had a white
robe, as white as the sepulchres of the Pharisees, covering all
these things.&nbsp; Satan held these up to deceive before the eye
of God, and all the terrors of eternity.&nbsp; To sustain them
from fainting, he administered unto them his potions from the
pitcher of presumption; and hardened their consciences with the
hot iron of hypocrisy, heated in the fire of hell.&nbsp; He
taught them to persecute religion in the garb of an angel.</p>
<p>Let us not give room to the devil in his white raiment!&nbsp;
When he attempts to destroy the character of a brother, he
assumes his white robe, and not his murdering garment, pretending
to vindicate the glory of God and the cause of justice, asserting
that the cause of religion must be cleared; while all this time
envy rankles in his heart, notwithstanding his fair pretences, as
when the Jews delivered Jesus to be crucified.&nbsp; It was his
white garment that Satan wore in the court of Caiaphas, when he
charged the true God with blasphemy.&nbsp; This garb, also, his
servant Judas wore, when he displayed such zeal and sympathy for
the poor, in the case of the ointment at Bethany.&nbsp; Let us
ask grace, that we may be able to recognise the devil in his
white raiment, as well as in his old black-red garb.&nbsp; He is
not so easily distinguished in his borrowed white, as in his own
proper suit.&nbsp; Let us cleanse out hypocrisy.&nbsp; Such is
our instruction.</p>
<h3><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>V.&nbsp; THE YOUNG CHILD.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Herod</span> said to the wise men,
&ldquo;Go and search diligently for the young child.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The magi immediately commenced their inquiries, according to the
instructions they received.&nbsp; I see them approaching some
village, and when they come to the gate they inquire, &ldquo;Do
you know any thing of the young child?&rdquo;&nbsp; The gateman
comes to the door; and, supposing them to have asked the amount
of the toll, says, &ldquo;O, three halfpence an ass is to
pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We do not ask what is to pay,&rdquo;
reply they, &ldquo;but, do you know any thing of the young
child?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No; I know nothing in the
world,&rdquo; answers he; &ldquo;but there is a
blacksmith&rsquo;s shop a little farther on; inquire there, and
you will be very likely to obtain some intelligence concerning
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wise men proceed, and when they come to the
blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, they ask, &ldquo;Do you know any thing
of the young child?&rdquo;&nbsp; A harsh voice answers,
&ldquo;There is no such thing possible for you, as having the
asses shod now; you shall in two hours hence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We do not ask you to shoe the asses,&rdquo; say they;
&ldquo;but inquire for the young child, if you know any thing of
him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing in the world,&rdquo; says the
blacksmith; &ldquo;but inquire at the tavern that is on your
road, and probably you may hear something of him
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On they go, and stand opposite the door of the tavern, and
cry, &ldquo;Do you know any thing of the young
child?&rdquo;&nbsp; The landlord, thinking they call for porter,
bids the servant attend, saying, &ldquo;Go, girl; go with a quart
of porter to the strangers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We do not ask for
either porter or ale,&rdquo; say the wise men; &ldquo;but
something about the young child that is born.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know nothing in the world of him,&rdquo; says the
landlord; &ldquo;but turn to the shop on the left hand; the
shopkeeper reads all the papers, and you will be likely to hear
something respecting him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They proceed accordingly towards the shop, and repeat their
inquiry, &ldquo;Do you know any thing of the young child,
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; The shopkeeper says to his apprentice,
&ldquo;Reach half a quarter of tobacco <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>to the
strangers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We do not ask for tobacco,&rdquo;
say the wise men; &ldquo;but for some intelligence of the young
child.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not know any thing of him,&rdquo;
replies the shopkeeper; &ldquo;but there is an old Rabbi living
in the upper end of the village; call on him, and very probably
he will give you all the information you desire respecting the
object of your search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They immediately direct their course towards the house of the
Rabbi; and having reached it, they knock at the door; and being
admitted into his presence, they ask him if he knows any thing of
the young child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; says he; and when
they have entered and are seated, the Rabbi refers to his books
and chronicles, and says he to the wise men, &ldquo;There is
something wonderful about to take place; some remarkable person
has been or is to be born; but the best thing for you is to go
down yonder street; there is living there, by the river side, the
son of an old priest; you will be sure to know all of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having bid the old Rabbi a respectful farewell, on they go;
and reaching the river&rsquo;s side, they inquire of the
by-standers for the son of the old priest.&nbsp; Immediately he
is pointed out to them.&nbsp; There is a &ldquo;raiment of
camel&rsquo;s hair about him, and a leathern girdle about his
loins.&rdquo;&nbsp; They ask him if he knows any thing of the
young child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;there he
is: behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the
world!&nbsp; There he is; he will bruise the dragon&rsquo;s head,
and bring in everlasting righteousness to every one that
believeth in his name.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>VI.&nbsp; VARIETIES OF PREACHING.</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">perceive</span> four strong men on their
journey toward Lazarus&rsquo; grave, for the purpose of raising
him to life.&nbsp; One of them, who is eminent for his piety,
says, &ldquo;I will descend into the grave, and will take with me
a bowl of the salt of duties, and will rub him well with the
sponge of natural ability.&rdquo;&nbsp; He enters the grave, and
commences his rubbing process.&nbsp; I watch his operations at a
distance, and after a while inquire, &ldquo;Well, are there any
symptoms of life there?&nbsp; Does he arise, does he breathe, my
brother?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; replies he,
&ldquo;he is still quiet, and I cannot salt him to
<i>will</i>&mdash;and besides this, his smell is rather
heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the second, &ldquo;come you out; I
was afraid that your means would not answer the purpose; let me
enter the grave.&rdquo;&nbsp; The second enters, carrying in his
hand a whip of the scorpions of threatening; and, says he,
&ldquo;I will make him feel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He directs his scorpion
and fiery ministry at the dead corpse; but in vain, and I hear
him crying out, &ldquo;All is unsuccessful; dead he is after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Says the third, &ldquo;Make room for me to enter, and I will
see if I cannot bring him to life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He enters the
grave, and takes with him a musical pipe; it is melodious as the
song of love; but there is no dancing in the grave.</p>
<p>The fourth says, &ldquo;Means of themselves can effect
nothing, but I will go for Jesus, who is the resurrection and the
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Immediately he leaves to seek for Christ, and
speedily returns, accompanied by the Saviour.&nbsp; And when the
Lord came, he stands in the door of the sepulchre, and cries out,
&ldquo;Lazarus, come forth!&rdquo; and the dead body is
instantaneously instinct with life.</p>
<p>Let our confidence be in the voice of the Son of God.&nbsp;
And let us turn our faces toward the wind, and say, &ldquo;O
breath, come from the four winds, and breathe upon these slain,
that they may live!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>VII.&nbsp; THE SIX CROCODILES.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> church-member should learn to
hunt a crocodile.&nbsp; The first crocodile is a spirit to search
closely for faults, instead of hiding them with brotherly love,
according to the directions of the gospel.&nbsp; This is Ham, the
old crocodile, that exposed the nakedness of his father, instead
of hiding it like Shem and Japheth; for which his father banished
him to the river Nilus, where he still remains in Africa, under
the curse of his father.</p>
<p>Old pious Eli erred greatly, by allowing his children to enter
the sanctuary as crocodiles, by sparing them, and suffering them
in their sins, which brought, through these crocodiles,
destruction on his house: and in the same manner since upon many
congregations,&mdash;as the churches of Asia.&nbsp; This is an
evil spirit in the mount.</p>
<p>Another crocodile is the spirit of preference.&nbsp; This is
the crocodile Judas, who was offended with Jesus in Bethany on
account of Mary&rsquo;s ointment, which she poured on the head of
Jesus; and that only because they did not consult him; in revenge
for which he turned traitor.&nbsp; He was a selfish miser; and
ultimately hung himself, and went to his own place.&nbsp; This
crocodile still lurks among the reeds.&nbsp; There are many like
him, ready to blame every act of discipline in the church; not
that they care so much for the interests of the church, or any
belonging to it, but they wish to swallow all up themselves.</p>
<p>Another crocodile is the spirit of Ahithophel, who plotted a
cunning artifice to dethrone a person whose heart was with God,
and raise Absalom, a wicked man like himself, to the throne in
his stead.&nbsp; God turned his counsel into foolishness.&nbsp;
He was disappointed&mdash;his heart failed&mdash;he saddled his
ass, and went and hung himself.&nbsp; This was the end of that
crocodile.</p>
<p>Another is a spirit to trample and destroy, for the sake of
being head.&nbsp; This is the crocodile Joab, who killed Abner,
who was better than himself.&nbsp; This crocodile strikes every
one who may be in his way under the fifth rib, for the sake of
being head himself.&nbsp; But <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>his end came; he lost his life at
the horns of the altar, by the sword with which he himself
destroyed another.</p>
<p>But, upon looking again, we see the sixth crocodile, and his
name is Cain, who would triumph over God and man; without grace,
or talents, or faith, or love; and without any sacrifice that has
blood in it; and because God will not regard him without faith,
he opens his mouth, and sets himself to swallow pious Abel.&nbsp;
God delivers him over to the possession of the wicked one.</p>
<p>O brethren, let us prove the spirits, whether they are of God,
or of the devil!</p>
<p>I will tell you an anecdote of Mr. Rowlands, of
Llangeitho.&nbsp; When he wished to crush the spirit of calumny
(the crocodile Ham) which lurked in the church, he said to the
slanderer: &ldquo;Thou sayest, man, that sins must be hunted and
exposed, because they are too numerous in the church&mdash;and
that they ought not be hidden.&nbsp; Be quiet, man.&nbsp; Who art
thou?&nbsp; I think I know thy family, and thy eldest brother,
even Ham, the son of Noah.&nbsp; His two brothers wished to hide
their father&rsquo;s nakedness, but he would expose it.&nbsp;
What reward did they receive for covering their father&rsquo;s
nakedness?&nbsp; The blessing of God and their father.&nbsp; And
what reward did thy brother receive?&nbsp; The curse of God and
their father.&nbsp; And I doubt not thy reward will be nothing
better.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>VIII.&nbsp; ENVIOUS AMBITION.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> forest of Lebanon once held a
consultation to choose a king, upon the death of the king, the
Yew-tree.&nbsp; They agreed to offer the crown to the Cedar; and
if the Cedar should refuse, to invite the Vine and the Olive to
office.&nbsp; They all refused the honors for the following
reasons.&nbsp; The Cedar refused, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; said be,
&ldquo;I am sufficiently high as I am.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
would rather,&rdquo; said the Vine, &ldquo;yield wine to cheer
others, than receive for myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the same
manner, the Olive preferred giving its oil to honor others rather
than receive any honors to itself.</p>
<p>All these having refused the honors offered them, they next
agreed to call the Thorn to the government; and if he should
decline, to choose the Bramble.&nbsp; The White Thorn, in its
beautiful dress, received the honor, speaking thus to
itself:&mdash;&ldquo;I have nothing to lose but the white coat,
and some red berries; and I have prickles enough to hurt the
whole forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the Bramble instigated a rebellion
against the White Thorn, and kindled the fire of pride in the
forest, so that all the trees were set on flame.</p>
<p>Two or three vain and proud men in a peaceful congregation,
have, by contending for the preference, disturbed the peace, and
obstructed the prosperity of many a church, while there was no
more virtue in them than there is of value in the white thorn or
prickly bramble.</p>
<h3><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>IX.&nbsp; THE DOVE, THE RAVEN, AND THE EAGLE.</h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">nobleman</span> had a Dove, a Raven, and
an Eagle, belonging to his palace.&nbsp; There was no sociability
or fellowship prevailing among them.&nbsp; The Dove fed on its
own food, and hid herself in the clefts of the rocks, or in the
dove-house near the palace.&nbsp; The Raven fed upon dead
carcasses, and sometimes picked out the eyes of little innocent
lambs, if she could pounce upon them in a chance place;&mdash;she
also nestled in the top of the trees.&nbsp; The Eagle was a royal
bird, flying very high, but yet of a rapacious character.&nbsp;
Sometimes he would not mind eating some half a dozen of the Doves
for his breakfast.&nbsp; He thought himself the king of birds
because he flew higher than they all.&nbsp; The Doves greatly
dreaded his strong beak, his wrathful eyes, and his sharp
grappling claws.&nbsp; When the gentleman threw wheat for the
Dove on the pavement, the Raven would have a piece of an ear or
the foot of a lamb in its beak; and the Eagle was for taking up
some little child from the cradle to his nest.</p>
<p>The Dove is the pious diligent Christian; the Raven is the
dissolute and difficult to be managed; and the proud, selfish
professor is the Eagle.&nbsp; These three characters are too
frequently to be found together, and there is no denomination, in
church or chapel, without these three birds, if there are any
birds at all there.&nbsp; It is impossible for three birds, so
different in their dispositions, ever to be happy together.&nbsp;
Brethren, pray for the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace.</p>

<p>The demand of the public for Historical Works, and especially
for those which relate to the history of our own country, has
increased so rapidly of late, that HISTORY may now be pronounced
the leading department of literature.&nbsp; Not only classical
histories, but every other description of books which may be
expected to throw light upon history, are eagerly demanded.&nbsp;
Biographies and Memoirs of Distinguished Men, local Histories,
Historical and Topographical accounts of States, Historical
Collections, Correspondence of Generals, Commodores, and
Statesmen, State papers, and documents of all kinds, old and new,
find a ready sale as soon as they are published.&nbsp; This
decided taste of the public for historical reading, whilst it is
hailed by the patriot and the friend of sound popular education
as an evidence of increased intelligence among the people, points
out distinctly the duties of authors and publishers, to
contribute their best efforts towards the substitution of books
of real utility, instead of the lighter and less useful
publications, which have heretofore had too free a currency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Biography of this most
distinguished and honored Statesman is eminently fraught with
encouragement and hope for aspiring youth&mdash;especially for
those who enter upon the stage of active life, unportioned and
unheralded by the partial voice of powerful friends and
kindred.&nbsp; Henry Clay was one of the many among our eminent
men who, besides the disadvantages of poverty and obscurity, were
fated to encounter that of early orphanage.&nbsp; Yet his
subsequent career emphatically teaches that no one who is
conscious of possessing the requisite qualities need ever
apprehend that humility of origin or obscurity of position will
deprive him of opportunities to serve and honor his
country.&nbsp; The work here presented is intended to trace
clearly the career of Mr. Clay, from his entrance on the stage of
public life down to the period of his death&mdash;mainly by the
right of his own lofty, persuasive, and impassioned
eloquence.&nbsp; Mr. Clay&rsquo;s parliamentary efforts, clear,
direct, and vigorous, embody all the illustration that is needful
to their full understanding&mdash;the great importance, variety,
and indestructible interest of the topics he generally
discussed&mdash;the character and ability of the orator, the
direct and exact bearing of his arguments on the controversies
and interests of the times&mdash;all combine to render his
speeches among the most valuable contributions of Patriotism and
Genius to the enlightenment and elevation of the American
people.</p>

<b>HISTORY OF THE WORLD.</b><br />
MAGNIFICENTLY ILLUSTRATED!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> work now offered to the public
is designed to fill up a great chasm in one <i>most important</i>
department of literature.&nbsp; To satisfy a want felt, not only
by the student, by the man left to himself for an education, but
also by the intelligent of all classes of society.&nbsp; It will
supply the great mass of the public, who are at present almost
necessarily in the dark as to the past world and its destinies,
with a complete picture of all the great events relating to the
world and to man, from the earliest dawn of history down to the
present time; and we indulge the hope that it will satisfy the
universal want of a good General History of the World.&nbsp; We
have works entitled &ldquo;Histories of the World,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Universal Histories,&rdquo; it is true; but all of them
(we mean those in a small form, and such as are within the reach
of the generality of readers) are sadly deficient, ill-selected,
and worse arranged: they could not, according to the ideas of the
author of this work, be considered, strictly speaking, <span
class="smcap">General Histories of the World</span>.</p>
<p>The author of this History is celebrated throughout Europe as
a <i>scholar</i>, as a <i>statesman</i>, and as a <i>bold
defender of liberty</i>; and this reputation will certainly be an
excellent recommendation of his work to the American
public.&nbsp; Although born in Germany, educated in its far-famed
halls of learning, and breathing a <i>German</i> atmosphere, he
is not a German alone; he is a man whom the world may
claim.&nbsp; He is no mystic, full of unintelligible, useless
theories; but a man devoted to practicable objects, to the
welfare of his race, and to pure religion and morality.</p>
<p>His History has been extensively circulated in Europe (<i>in
the German</i>, <i>French</i>, <i>Dutch</i>, <i>Swedish</i>,
<i>and Danish languages</i>), and is the most popular one that
has ever been published.&nbsp; For, although he may be ranked as
the first historian of Europe, he has written, not for a
particular class, but for people in general.&nbsp; In fine, his
History is equally fitted for the <i>student</i>, the
<i>merchant</i>, the <i>farmer</i>, the <i>mechanic</i>, and the
<i>professional man</i>.</p>

LEGACY;</b><br />
<span class="GutSmall">OR,</span><br />
<b>BIBLE DIRECTORY.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>BY THE REV. WILLIAM
JACKSON.</b></p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>THE CHRISTIAN&rsquo;S LEGACY having gone through 10 editions,
in a short space of time, the writer has no other apology to
offer for the 11th edition, than a belief of its proving useful
to <i>all</i> Christians of every denomination.</p>
<p>A conviction that a knowledge of the Bible, above all other
books, is calculated &ldquo;<i>to make one wise</i>;&rdquo; and
that an advantage is given to the enemy by not attending to our
Lord&rsquo;s admonition, &ldquo;<i>Search the
Scriptures</i>,&rdquo; led to an attempt to assist the inquirer
in his &ldquo;<i>Search</i>&rdquo; after <span
class="GutSmall">TRUTH</span>.</p>
<p>The design of the work is, to make the reading and study of
the <i>Holy Scriptures</i> more easy and delightful; especially
to those who have but few helps, little time for studying, or are
young in years.&nbsp; The <i>plan</i> is new; and the arrangement
so simple, that no one, not even a child, need mistake it; but
may, without knowing a word of the Bible beforehand, find
whatever the Scriptures contain on any subject, as readily as
though he knew the whole Bible by heart.</p>
<p>It is a handsome volume of 420 full pages, printed with good
type, on clear, fine white paper; is handsomely bound and
lettered, with a striking likeness of the author.</p>
<p>The first 310 pages contain as many subjects, adapted to every
state and condition of the Christian in Life, Death, the Grave,
and beyond the grave, as far as the Bible goes but no farther:
for there is not a <i>sectarian</i> expression to be found in the
work.&nbsp; Each Page is complete of itself.</p>
<p>The last 110 pages contain a compendium of every book in the
Bible, with the history of the several writers, &amp;c.; together
with the character of the first Christians&mdash;the
example&mdash;miracles&mdash;parables&mdash;and remarkable
discourses of Christ&mdash;the prophecies with their
fulfillment&mdash;figurative and symbolical language of the
Bible, alphabetically arranged, with the import of each
word&mdash;a description of the Jewish offerings; and the
different Sects mentioned in the Scriptures&mdash;Scriptural
difficulties accounted for&mdash;fate of the Evangelists and
Apostles&mdash;Hebrew offices&mdash;a Pronouncing Dictionary of
the &ldquo;<i>hard names</i>&rdquo; in the Old and New Testament,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>An <i>alphabetical</i> <span class="smcap">Index</span> is
placed in the former part of the book, and by consulting which,
the reader may readily find an answer to any question, that may
be asked him by any Bible question-book, or individual;
providing, that it is a question that would benefit any one to
have answered, is <i>not</i> Sectarian, and is one that the
<i>Bible</i> can answer.</p>

teaching him the important practical facts contained herein, may
enable him to save the life even of the meanest animal on his

added such notes, and made such corrections and additions as were

<p>The plan on which the work is formed, was to select only the

value of sound education, should be well informed.&nbsp; The
<i>minuti&aelig;</i> of biography, topography, scientific
technicalities, and other matters to which there may be only need

rid of.&nbsp; There only remains a series of articles on the MOST
IMPORTANT BRANCHES OF SCIENCE, PHYSICAL, MATHEMATICAL, AND MORAL;
NATURAL HISTORY, POLITICAL HISTORY, GEOGRAPHY.&nbsp; AND GENERAL
LITERATURE.&nbsp; All is given which, if studied and received
into the mind, would make an individual, in the common walks of

addition to the closely condensed printed matter, it has bean
necessary to execute upwards of FIVE HUNDRED ENGRAVINGS, in order

young in years.&nbsp; The <i>plan</i> is new; and the arrangement
so simple, that no one, not even a child, need mistake it; but
may, without knowing a word of the Bible beforehand, find
whatever the Scriptures contain on any subject, as readily as
though he knew the whole Bible by heart.</p>
<p>It is a handsome volume of 420 full pages, printed with good
type, on clear, fine white paper; is handsomely bound and
lettered, with a striking likeness of the author.</p>
<p>The first 310 pages contain as many subjects, adapted to every
state and condition of the Christian in Life, Death, the Grave,
and beyond the grave, as far as the Bible goes but no farther:
for there is not a <i>sectarian</i> expression to be found in the
work.&nbsp; Each Page is complete of itself.</p>
<p>The last 110 pages contain a compendium of every book in the
Bible, with the history of the several writers, &amp;c.; together
with the character of the first Christians&mdash;the
example&mdash;miracles&mdash;parables&mdash;and remarkable
discourses of Christ&mdash;the prophecies with their
fulfillment&mdash;figurative and symbolical language of the
Bible, alphabetically arranged, with the import of each
word&mdash;a description of the Jewish offerings; and the
different Sects mentioned in the Scriptures&mdash;Scriptural
difficulties accounted for&mdash;fate of the Evangelists and
Apostles&mdash;Hebrew offices&mdash;a Pronouncing Dictionary of
the &ldquo;<i>hard names</i>&rdquo; in the Old and New Testament,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>An <i>alphabetical</i> <span class="smcap">Index</span> is
placed in the former part of the book, and by consulting which,
the reader may readily find an answer to any question, that may
be asked him by any Bible question-book, or individual;
providing, that it is a question that would benefit any one to
have answered, is <i>not</i> Sectarian, and is one that the
<i>Bible</i> can answer.</p>

class="footnote">[114]</a>&nbsp; The substance of this
transcendent passage Christmas Evans often repeated in his
preaching, and of course with considerable variation on different
occasions.&nbsp; There are two other versions of it in
English.&nbsp; One of them, translated many years ago, and
published under the title of &ldquo;A Specimen of Welsh
Preaching,&rdquo; has been everywhere justly admired, as one of
the finest productions of sanctified genius.&nbsp; The other,
which we give below, was taken from the lips of the preacher, and
rendered into English, by one of his frequent hearers and
intimate friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the stores of his
energy,&rdquo; says the editor of the English memoir, &ldquo;and
the resources of his voice, which was one of great compass,
depth, and sweetness, seemed reserved for the closing portions of
the picture, when he delineated the routed and battered hosts of
the pit retreating from the cross, where they had anticipated a
triumph, and met a signal and irretrievable
overthrow.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor</span>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks I find myself standing upon the summit of one
of the highest of the everlasting hills, permitted thence to take
a survey of our earth.&nbsp; It shows to me a wide and far-spread
burial-ground, over which lie scattered in countless multitudes
the wretched and perishing children of Adam.&nbsp; The ground is
full of hollow&rsquo;s, the yawning caverns of death, while over
it broods a thick cloud of fearful darkness.&nbsp; No light from
above shines upon it, nor is the ray of the sun or moon, or the
beams of a candle seen through all its borders.&nbsp; It is
walled around.&nbsp; Its gates, large and massive, ten thousand
times stronger than all the gates of brass forged among men, are
one and all safely locked.&nbsp; It is the hand of Divine Justice
that has locked them, and so firmly secured are the strong bolts
which hold those doors, that all the created powers even of the
heavenly world, were they to labor to all eternity, could not
drive so much as one of them back.&nbsp; How hopeless the
wretchedness to which the race are doomed, and into what
irrecoverable depths of ruin has the disobedience of their first
parent plunged them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But behold, in the cool of the day there is seen
descending from the eternal hills in the distance, the radiant
form of Mercy, seated in the chariot of the divine promise, and
clothed with splendor, infinitely brighter than the golden rays
of the morning when seen shooting over mountains of pearls.&nbsp;
Seated beside Mercy in that chariot is seen another form like
unto the Son of man.&nbsp; His mysterious name is the &lsquo;Seed
of the Woman,&rsquo; and girt around him shines the girdle of
eternity, radiant with the lustre of the heaven of heavens.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He has descended into the lower parts of the
earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; I see Mercy alight from that chariot, and she
is knocking at the huge gate of this vast cemetery.&nbsp; She
asks of Justice: &lsquo;Is there no entrance into this field of
death?&nbsp; May I not visit these caverns of the grave, and
seek, if it may be, to raise some names at least of the children
of destruction, and bring them again to the light of day?&nbsp;
Open, Justice, open; drive back these iron bolts and let me in,
that I may proclaim the jubilee of deliverance to the children of
the dust.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I hear the stern reply of Justice from
within those walls; it is,&mdash;&lsquo;Mercy, surely thou lovest
Justice too well, to wish to burst these gates by force of arm,
and thus obtain entrance by mere lawless violence.&nbsp; And I
cannot open the door.&nbsp; I cherish no anger towards the
unhappy wretches.&nbsp; I have no delight in their eternal death,
or in hearing their cries as they lie upon the burning hearth of
the great fire kindled by the wrath of God, in the land that is
lower than the grave.&nbsp; But I am bound to vindicate the
purity, holiness, and equity of God&rsquo;s laws; for,
&lsquo;without shedding of blood there is no
remission.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Be it so,&rsquo; said Mercy,
&lsquo;but wilt thou not accept of a surety who may make a
sufficient atonement for the crime committed and the offence
given?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That will I,&rsquo; said Justice,
&lsquo;only let him be duly allied to either party in this sad
controversy, a kinsman, near alike to the injured Lawgiver, and
to the guilty tenants of the burial-ground.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wilt thou, then,&rsquo; said Mercy, &lsquo;accept of the
puissant Michael, prince among the hosts of heaven, who fought
bravely in the day when there was war in heaven, and also
vanquished Apollyon upon the summit of the everlasting
hills?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;&mdash;said Justice,
&lsquo;I may not, for his goings forth are not from the
beginning, even from everlasting.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Wilt thou
not then accept of the valiant Gabriel, who compelled Beelzebub
to turn and seek safety in flight from the walls of the heavenly
city?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;&mdash;cried Justice,
&lsquo;for Gabriel is already bound to render his appointed
service to the King Almighty; and who may serve in his place
while he should be attempting the salvation of Adam&rsquo;s
race?&nbsp; There needs,&rsquo; continued Justice, &lsquo;one who
has, of right belonging to him, both omnipotence and eternity, to
achieve the enterprise.&nbsp; Let him clothe himself with the
nature of these wretches.&nbsp; Let him be born within these
gloomy walls, and himself undergo death within this
unapproachable place, if he would buy the favor of Heaven for
these children of the captivity!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But while this dialogue was held, behold, a form fairer
than the morning dawn, and full of the glory of heaven, is seen
descending from that chariot.&nbsp; Casting, as he passes, a
glance of infinite benignity upon the hapless tenants of that
burial-ground, he approaches, and asks of Justice: &lsquo;Wilt
thou accept of me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said
Justice, &lsquo;for greater art thou than heaven and the whole
universe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Behold, then,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;I
come: in the volume of the book has it been written of me.&nbsp;
I will go down, in the fulness of time, into the sides of the pit
of corruption.&nbsp; I will lay hold of this nature, and take
upon me the dust of Eden, and, allied to that dust, I will pour
into thy balance, Justice, blood of such worth and virtue that
the court of heaven shall pronounce its claims satisfied, and bid
the children of the great captivity go free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Centuries have rolled by, and the fulness of time is
now accomplished; and see, an infant of days is born within the
old burial ground of Eden.&nbsp; Behold a Son given to the
dwellers of the tomb, and a spotless Lamb, the Lamb of God, is
seen within that gloomy enclosure.&nbsp; When the hour came at
which the ministers of the Divine Justice must seize upon the
victim, I see them hurrying towards Gethsemane.&nbsp; There, in
heaviness and sorrow of soul, praying more earnestly, the surety
is seen bowed to the earth, and the heavy burden he had assumed
is now weighing him down.&nbsp; Like a lamb, he is led towards
Golgotha&mdash;the hill of skulls.&nbsp; There are mustered all
the hosts of darkness, rejoicing in the hope of their speedy
conquest over him.&nbsp; The monsters of the pit, huge, fierce,
and relentless, are there.&nbsp; The lions, <a
name="citation116a"></a><a href="#footnote116a"
class="citation">[116a]</a> as in a great army, were grinding
fearfully their teeth, ready to tear him in pieces.&nbsp; The
unicorns, <a name="citation116b"></a><a href="#footnote116b"
class="citation">[116b]</a> a countless host, were rushing
onwards to thrust him through, and trample him beneath their
feet.&nbsp; And there were the bulls of Bashan, <a
name="citation116c"></a><a href="#footnote116c"
class="citation">[116c]</a> roaring terribly; the dragons <a
name="citation116d"></a><a href="#footnote116d"
class="citation">[116d]</a> of the pit are unfolding themselves,
and shooting out their stings, and dogs <a
name="citation116e"></a><a href="#footnote116e"
class="citation">[116e]</a> many are all around the
mountain.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is the hour and power of
darkness.&rsquo;&nbsp; I see him passing along through this dense
array of foes, an unresisting victim.&nbsp; He is nailed to the
cross; and now Beelzebub and all the master-spirits in the hosts
of hell have formed, though invisible to man, a ring around the
cross.&nbsp; It was about the third hour of the day, or the hour
of nine in the morning, that he was bound as a sacrifice, even to
the horns of the altar.&nbsp; The fire of divine vengeance has
fallen, and the flames of the curse have now caught upon
him.&nbsp; The blood of the victim is fast dropping, and the
hosts of hell are shouting impatiently: &lsquo;The victory will
soon be ours.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the fire went on burning until the
ninth hour of the day, or the hour of three in the afternoon,
when it touched his Deity,&mdash;and then it expired.&nbsp; For
the ransom was now paid and the victory won.&nbsp; It was
his.&nbsp; His hellish foes, crushed in his fall, the unicorns
and the bulls of Bashan retreated from the encounter with
shattered horns; the jaws of the lions had been broken and their
claws torn off, and the old dragon, with bruised head, dragged
himself slowly away from the scene, in deathlike
feebleness.&nbsp; &lsquo;He triumphed over them openly,&rsquo;
and now is He for ever the Prince and Captain of our salvation,
made perfect through sufferings.&nbsp; The graves of the old
burial-ground have been thrown open; and from yonder hills gales
of life have blown down upon this valley of dry bones, and an
exceedingly great army have already been sealed to our God, as
among the living in Zion.&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
